Irritable Bowel Syndrome — 
Clinical Evaluation of  Drugs for Treatment 
This guidance represents the Food and Drug Administrati on’s (FDA’s) current thinking on this topic.  It 
does not create or confer any rights for or on any pe rson and does not operate to bind FDA or the public.  
You can use an alternative approach if the approach  satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes 
and regulations.  If you want to discuss an alterna tive approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for 
implementing this guidance.  If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate 
number listed on the title page of this guidance. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
This guidance is intended to assist the pha rmaceutical industry and investigators who are 
developing drugs2 for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).  IBS diagnosis and 
assessment of clinical status depend mainly on an  evaluation of IBS signs and symptoms that are 
known to the patient. Capturing all of the clinic ally important signs and symptoms associated 
with IBS in a reliable measure of treatment benefit can be challeng ing.  The guidance for 
industry Patient-Reported Outcome Measures:  Use in Medical Product Development to Support 
Labeling Claims  (PRO guidance)3 defines the term treatment benefit  as “[t]he effect of treatment 
on how a patient survives, feels, or functions.” 
This guidance addresses two main topics.  Sectio n III discusses the evolution of patient-reported 
outcome (PRO) measures as primary endpoints for IBS clinical trials; an d section IV provides a 
set of provisional endpoints and trial design re commendations that sponsors may apply to IBS 
clinical trials as PRO measurements continue to evolve.  The guidance also discusses, in section 
V, the future development of IBS PRO instru ments through the FDA qualification process and 
the FDA’s collaboration with the Critical Path Institute.  The recommendations provided in this 
guidance are consistent with good measurement scie nce as reflected in other FDA guidance.

The goal for efficacy endpoints in IBS clinical trials  is to assess the treatment effect on the core 
disease-defining signs and symptoms of IBS in a well-defined and reliable way.  Until such 
endpoints are available, the provi sional endpoint assessments sugge sted in this guidance can be 
used in the evaluation of treatment benefit in IBS clinical trials. 
This guidance applies to the IBS indications for IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D) and IBS with 
constipation (IBS-C). Sponsors should contac t the Division of Gast roenterology and Inborn 
Errors Products to discuss endpoint assessm ents and trial design proposals for other IBS 
populations not discussed in this guidance (i.e ., mixed irritable bowel syndrome and unsubtyped 
irritable bowel syndrome). FDA’s guidance documents, including this guid ance, do not establish legally enforceable 
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe th e Agency’s current thinki ng on a topic and should 
be viewed only as recommendations, unless spec ific regulatory or stat utory requirements are 
cited. The use of the word should  in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or 
recommended, but not required.  
II. BACKGROUND 
IBS is a complex condition that is not well- linked to any readily measured physiological 
abnormality.  Despite advances in our understandi ng of basic neuroenteric mechanisms and the 
role of effectors and transmitters in the brain-gut  axis, a reliable biologic marker of IBS has yet 
to be indentified.
4  PRO measures of the signs and symptoms of the condition are the only 
currently available measures that can adequately de fine a treatment effect in a clinical trial.  
III. EVOLUTION OF PRO MEASURES IN IBS CLINICAL TRIALS 
An adequate measure of trea tment benefit should capture th e most significant signs and 
symptoms of IBS.  The primary challenge in designi ng clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of 
drugs for this condition has been to  define the critical signs and sy mptoms that are most relevant 
to patients, and then select or develop adequate assessment tools that measure improvement and 
decrements in these import ant signs and symptoms.   
In the past, IBS clinical trials commonly used  a single-item patient-reported rating of overall 
change in condition as the primary efficacy endpoint.5  When the single-item patient-reported 
rating of change was used as the primary endpoint , specific IBS signs and symptoms were often 
included as separate secondary endpoints.  As detailed in Table 1, examples of single-item 
patient-reported ratings of ch ange have included questi ons posed to patients about adequate 
relief or satisfactory relief and the single item Subject Global Assessmen t of Relief of IBS 
symptoms . Usually, the patient-reporte d ratings of change required patients to average either 
specific symptoms (e.g., abdominal pain or discom fort) or all signs and symptoms of IBS over a

week’s time, and then compare this average to a period in the past, typica lly before trial entry.  
Table 1 describes primary endpoints that have been  used in several IBS clinical trials.  Although 
these endpoints may well have captured the dire ction of change (trial s were controlled and 
blinded), they could not provide useful informati on on the effect of treatm ent on the severity of a 
specific sign or symptom.

3 See reference number 23 in the References section at the end of the guidance. 
As noted above, the PRO guidance defines treatment benefit  as the effect of treatment on how a 
patient survives, feels, or functions. PRO instruments define and capture the patient’s 
perspective with respect to th e disease or condition of intere st and can be appropriate for 
measuring the effect of treatment in a clinical trial, particularly when the desired effect of the treatment is on signs and symptoms known only to the patient.  Consistent with FDA regulations 
for drug approval, the effectiveness of a treat ment must be based on substantial evidence 
including evidence that the method of assessment of subjects’ responses are well-defined and reliable (21 CFR 314.126(b)(6)). The PRO guidance sets forth the FDA’s review principles for 
determining whether assessments are well-define d (i.e., valid) and adequately developed (i.e., 
reliable, sensitive, and interpretable) to measure what they are intended to measure.  
As reflected in the PRO guidance, the type of PRO instruments we  consider appropriate for data 
collection to support labeling claims has evolved from what was considered appropriate in the 
past. For example, we no longer recommend a single general item asking patients to rate change 
in their overall IBS symptoms as a primary endpoi nt to support an efficacy claim.  A single 
general item cannot adequately cap ture whether benefit is achieved in all, or only some, of the 
important signs and symptoms.  For example, a si ngle item that queries a patient about his or her 
3
   
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 
overall IBS experience will likely not capture a situation where the patient’s stool frequency has 
improved, but abdominal pain has not improved or even worsened.   
In recognition of the limitations of using a si ngle-item patient-reported rating of overall change 
as a primary endpoint and based on the principl es explained in the PRO guidance, we now 
recommend the development of a multi-item PR O instrument.  The PRO measure(s) should 
capture all of the clinically important signs and symptoms of the IB S target population (e.g., 
IBS-C or IBS-D). Changes from previous scores can then be calculated.  If a drug is developed 
specifically to improve only one of the major si gns or symptoms of IBS (e.g., abdominal pain), 
based on the drug’s mechanism of action, it is still  important to assess the other important signs 
and symptoms to document that the drug has no t negatively affected those components.  
Ultimately, the drug’s indication should reflect the findings from the clinical trials.   
IV. 	 PROVISIONAL ENDPOINTS AND TR IAL DESIGN FOR IBS CLINICAL 
TRIALS 
A well-defined and reliable PRO instrument that measures the clinically important signs and 
symptoms associated with each IB S subtype would be the ideal pr imary efficacy assessment tool 
in clinical trials used to support labeling claims , but at this time such an instrument is not 
available. We recognize that it will take some time to develop ad equate instruments and that in 
the meantime there is a great need to develop effective therapies for patients with IBS.  
Therefore, until the appropriate PRO instruments have been developed, sponsors should consider 
the strategies discussed in the following sections  when designing IBS c linical trials.  These 
sections set forth provisional sta ndards with regard to:  (1) tria l design; (2) tria l endpoints; (3) 
trial populations; (4) efficacy measures; and (5) definition of a responder. 
Following this discussion is Table 2, which summ arizes the provisional standards for IBS-C and 
IBS-D trial designs, including primary endpoint s, patient entry criteria, and responder 
definitions.  Table 2 is intended as a summary of  the discussion in this guidance.  Sponsors 
should refer to the text of the guidance for full detail.    
1. 	 Trial Design 
Because the clinical signs and symptoms associat ed with IBS-C and IBS-D can be significantly 
different, the two conditions ordi narily should be studied in separate clinical trials.  
A randomized, placebo-controlled trial design shoul d include a 1- to 2-week single-blind or 
open-label screening period. The 1- to 2-week screening period can be used to establish the 
presence and persistence of tria l entry criteria and train patien ts in the mode of PRO data 
collection selected for the trial.  The screening period can  also be used to select patients with 
specified levels of severity of signs and sympto ms.  For therapies that will be administered on a 
chronic and continuous basis, we recommend a treatment period of at least 8 weeks duration, 
followed by a randomized withdrawal design to a ddress the need for maintenance treatment to 
prevent sign or symptom recurrence.

For therapies with an intermittent administra tion schedule, sponsors should provide repeated 
courses of therapy to demonstrate sustained effi cacy over time, and to characterize the safety of 
intermittent and repeated administration.   
2. Trial Endpoints 
To support an indication of treatment of IBS, we recommend a primary endpoint that measures 
the effect of treatment on tw o major IBS signs and symptoms:  abnormal defecation and 
abdominal pain.6  The primary efficacy analysis should be a comparison of the response rates 
between investigational drug and placebo. 
For IBS-C, the defecation component of the pr oposed primary endpoint can be evaluated by 
assessing stool frequency. Stool  frequency, as measured by the number of complete spontaneous 
bowel movements (CSBMs) per week, is readily de fined, has been useful in defining a treatment 
response in chronic constipation c linical trials, and is clinically relevant for IBS-C patients.  
For IBS-D, the defecation component of the pr oposed primary endpoint can be evaluated by 
assessing stool consistency.7  The Bristol Stool Form Scale, which is reproduced in Figure 1, 
provides a pictorial and verbal de scription of stool consistency a nd form and is an appropriate 
instrument for capturing stool consistency in IBS trials.8

 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 
Stool frequency should be evalua ted as a key secondary endpoint, using the weekly number of 
CSBMs. Stool consistency, rather than stool frequency, is the recomm ended primary endpoint 
for IBS-D because it is more clinic ally relevant and better correla ted with signs and symptoms of 
diarrhea.  Currently, there are insufficient data to adequately quantify and qualify the concept of 
urgency based on the patient’s perspective and th us to support its use as a component of the 
primary endpoint definition of treatment response.  Until an adequate urgency assessment tool is 
developed, stool urgency should be assessed as an explorator y endpoint in IBS-D trials. 
The second component of the primary endpoint in  both IBS-C and IBS-D trials is abdominal 
pain. Although previous IBS clinical trials have used an item that assesses abdominal pain or 
discomfort , it is not clear whether th e abdominal pain and abdominal discomfort experienced by 
patients with IBS are synonymous or two differe nt symptoms.  Although adequate qualitative 
trials have not fully addressed these questions, clinical data provided to and reviewed by the 
FDA suggest that abdominal pain and discomfort  may be different symptoms that should be 
assessed by different questions. Because frank pain seems to be a symptom that is experienced 
with more significant intensity than discomfort and because the chronic pa in literature suggests 
that pain intensity may be a more clinical ly relevant assessment than pain frequency,9 we 
recommend abdominal pain intensity as the prim ary pain assessment in IBS trials.  Abdominal 
discomfort can be evaluated as a secondary endpoint. 
We recommend evaluating abdominal pain intensity  by using an 11-point (i .e., 0 to 10) numeric 
rating scale that asks pati ents daily to rate their worst abdominal pain over the past 24-hours .10 
This type of pain assessment has been used to  assess pain in somatic, visceral, and neuropathic 
chronic pain conditions.11 
A drug can be specifically developed to treat only  one of the major signs or symptoms of IBS, 
which should be identified as the primary endpoint in the clinical trial.  The identification of a 
single sign or symptom of interest should be ba sed on the mechanism of action of the drug.  The 
other key efficacy endpoints should be assessed in  the clinical trial as secondary endpoints.  
Demonstration of significant and clinically mean ingful changes in the targeted single endpoint 
could serve as a basis for approval, as long as the other important symptoms or signs have not 
worsened on treatment.    
3. Trial Populations 
Based upon the evolution of the IBS diagnostic crit eria, prospective IBS c linical trials should 
enroll patients who meet the subtype- specific Rome III IBS diagnostic criteria.12 In addition, 
patients who enter the trial should have the clinical  manifestations of IBS that will be assessed in

the trial to define treatment response, and the manifestations should be present with sufficient 
intensity to make demonstration of a clinically m eaningful improvement possible.  In light of the 
components of the primary endpoints for IBS-C a nd IBS-D previously de scribed, we recommend 
that trial entry criteria include the following:   
IBS-C 
 Abdominal Pain Intensity:  weekly average of worst daily (in past 24 hours) abdominal 
pain score of > 3.0 on a 0 to 10 point scale 
and 
	 Stool Frequency:   fewer than three CSBMs per week 
IBS-D 
 Abdominal Pain Intensity:  weekly average of worst daily (in past 24 hours) abdominal 
pain score of > 3.0 on a 0 to 10 point scale 
and 
	 Stool Consistency:   at least one stool with a consis tency of Type 6 or Type 7 Bristol 
stool score (BSS) on at least 2 days per week 
4. Efficacy Measures 
Sponsors should choose a format for daily sign or symptom assessment (e.g., interactive voice 
response or personal digital assist ant) so that patients can evalua te their IBS signs or symptoms 
on a daily basis throughout the tr ial.  When assessing responses,  sponsors should consider two 
distinct approaches:  (1) examining the differe nce in average score (or average change from 
baseline score) between the tr eated and untreated groups; or (2 ) examining the difference in 
response rate in the treated and untreated groups , where the response is prospectively defined 
and represents an effect consid ered clinically meaningful.  In  many instances, an effective drug 
will have an effect on both measures.   
5. Definition of a Responder 
Definitions of a responder for use in analyses of the primary endpoint should be prospectively 
described in the protocol and st atistical analysis plan.  A pati ent should be categorized as an 
overall responder if the patient achieved the prespecified improvement in weekly or daily 
response for at least 50 percent of the weeks or days of treatment (e.g., 6/12 weeks or 42/84 days). 
Our recommendations for how to define a weekly or daily response in each IBS setting is as 
follows:

A patient is categorized as a weekly responder  if the patient is a weekly responder in both 
pain intensity and stool frequency. 
	 An Abdominal Pain Intensity Weekly Responde r is defined as a patient who experiences 
a decrease in the weekly average of worst abdominal pain in the past 24 hours score 
(measured daily) of at least 30 percent co mpared with baseline weekly average  
	 A Stool Frequency Weekly Responder is de fined as a patient who experiences an 
increase of at least one CSBM per week from baseline

least 30 percent compar ed with baseline  
	 A Stool Consistency Weekly Responder is defined as a patient who experiences a 50 
percent or greater reduction in the number of days per week with at least one stool that 
has a consistency of Type 6 or 7 compared with baseline 
A patient is categorized as a daily responder if the patient is a responder in both  pain 
intensity and stool consistency. 
	 An Abdominal Pain Intensity Daily Responder is defined as a patient who experiences a 
decrease in worst abdominal pain in the past 24 hours  score of at least 30 percent 
compared with baseline  
	 A Stool Consistency Daily Responder is defi ned as a patient whose stool consistency 
(i.e., BSS) is less than 5 fo r all bowel movements on that day or no bowel movement  
For IBS-D, either the weekly responder or da ily responder definition may be acceptable.  For 
drugs intended to target only one major IBS sign or symptom, based on their mechanism of 
action, we recommend the following responder definitions: 
Abdominal pain in IBS-C 
 An Abdominal Pain Intensity Weekly Responde r is defined as a patient who experiences 
a decrease in the weekly average of worst abdo minal pain in the past 24 hours score of at 
least 30 percent compared with baseline.  St ool Frequency (for IBS-C) is unchanged or 
improved compared with baseline.   
13 Because IBS-C patients do not have daily bowel movements, even though abdominal pain may occur more 
frequently, daily response criteria are not relevant to this patient population.

	 An Abdominal Pain Intensity Daily Responder is defined as a patient who experiences a

Diarrhea in IBS-D 
	 A Stool Consistency Responder is defined as a patient who experien ces a 50 percent or 
greater reduction in the number of days with at least one st ool that has a consistency of 
Type 6 or 7 compared with baseline, and a bdominal pain is unchanged or improved in 
comparison with baseline 
Because the responder definitions described in this guidance are not supported by adequate 
content validation, it is unclear if they represent clinical ly meaningful changes in abdominal pain 
and abnormal defecation for patients with IBS.  The abdominal pain responder definition of a 
greater than or equal to 30 pe rcent reduction in abdomi nal pain intensity compared with baseline 
is primarily based on published literature  concerning other chr onic pain conditions.14 Therefore, 
we recommend conducting additional responder anal yses that evaluate greater reductions in 
abdominal pain intensity with treatment (i.e., greater than or equal to 40 and/or 50 percent 
reduction in abdominal pain intensity compared with  baseline).  In addition, it would be useful to 
examine the cumulative distribution of several ma gnitudes of abdominal pain intensity reduction 
associated with treatment (e.g., 30 percent, 40 pe rcent, 50 percent) as well as particular 
reductions (e.g., 100 percent pain intensity  reduction) as secondary endpoints.  
Although we do not recommend a pa tient rating of change as a primary endpoint, because a 
single general item cannot adequately capture th e treatment effect on a ll of the clinically 
important signs and symptoms of IBS, it can be us eful in defining a clini cally meaningful change 
in another measure through an anchor-based appr oach (relating changes in scores to a measure 
that is different from the specific measure itse lf).  Therefore, we r ecommend including patient 
ratings of change anchors as exploratory endpoints in conjunction with the endpoints included in 
this guidance. The global assessment should as k patients to evaluate only their current IBS

status and not compare their current IBS signs an d symptoms to another point in time, such as 
baseline status. Examples of such assessments  include the following questions, which could be 
asked of patients on a weekly basis: 
	 “How would you rate your abdominal pa in overall over th e past 7 days?” 
	 “How would you rate your constipation (for IB S-C) or diarrhea (for IBS-D) overall over 
the past 7 days?” 
	 “How would you rate your IBS signs or sy mptoms overall over the past 7 days?” 
Sponsors can consider Likert scale response options, such as:  2 = Significantly Relieved, 1 = 
Moderately Relieved, 0 = Unchanged, - 1 = Moderately Worse, and -2 = Significantly Worse.

V. FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF IBS PRO INSTRUMENTS
 
In October 2010, we published th e draft guidance for industry Qualification Process for Drug 
Development Tools.15  Drug development tools (DDTs) intend ed for potential use, over time, in 
multiple drug development programs include, but are not limited to, biomarkers and clinical 
outcome assessments including PRO instruments.  FDA qualification is a conclusion that within 
the stated context of use, the results of assessment with a DDT can be relied upon to have a 
specific interpretation and app lication in drug development and regulatory decision-making. 
The qualification process provides an effici ent means for DDT development.  Because 
qualification requires significant work, the form ation of collaborative groups may lessen the 
resource burden upon any individu al or company.  One such  collaborative group, the PRO 
Consortium, formed in 2008 at the Critical Path Institute, is a public-private partnership.  The 
PRO Consortium is charged with the task of effi ciently and collaboratively developing reliable, 
interpretable instruments that will be available in the public domain for all sponsors to use in 
medical product clinical trials.  The collaboration includes me mbers from the FDA, industry, 
academia, professional organizations, patient advo cacy groups, and other governmental agencies.  
Additional information about the PRO Consortium can be found at http://www.c-path.org. 
We are actively participating with the PRO Consor tium and others in the consultation and advice 
stage of qualification for the development of PRO measures of the signs and symptoms of IBS-C 
and IBS-D. Once qualified, these IBS subtype-specific PRO measures will replace the 
provisional endpoints described in this guidance as the FDA’ s recommended measures of 
treatment benefit for use in IBS-C and IBS-D clinical trials.  
VI. CONCLUSION 
The provisional endpoints and trial design reco mmendations in this guidance are currently 
acceptable for use in the evaluation of drugs fo r the treatment of IBS-D and IBS-C.  These 
recommendations will assist drug developers in developing treatments to address the needs of 
patients with IBS while the important work of developing well-defined and reliable PRO 
instruments for FDA qualification continues.   
15 When final, this guidance will represen t the FDA’s current thinking on this topic.  For the most recent version of a 
guidance, check the FDA Drugs guidance Web page at

I. INTRODUCTION  17 
 18 
The purpose of this guidance is to assist sponsors in the clinical development of drugs for 19 
treating  idiopathic an d diabetic gastroparesis.2  Specifically, this guidance addresses FDA’s 20 
current recommendations regarding clinical trial designs and clinical endpoint assessments to 21 
support developing gastroparesis drugs.  22 
 23 
This draft guidance is intended to serve as a focus for continued discussions among the 24 
responsible FDA division s in the Office of New Drugs , pharmaceutical sponsors, the academic 25 
community, and the public.3 26 
 27 
This guidance revises the draft guidance for industry of the same name issued in July 2015.  28 
Changes from the previous draft reflect FDA’s current thinking about developing clinical 29 
outcome assessment tools and statistical considerations for using those tools to assess  primary 30 
and secondary efficacy  endpoints . 31 
 32 
This guidance does not address detai led patient- reported outcome (PRO) instrument 33 
development and validation; these topics  are addressed in the guidance for i ndustry Patient - 34

In general, FDA’s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities.  42 
Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only 43 
as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirem ents are cited.  The use of 44 
the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but 45 
not required.  46

II. BACKGROUND  49 
 50 
Gastroparesis is a disorder characterized by  delayed gastric emptying (DGE)  in the absence of 51 
mechanical o bstruction .  Symptoms are chronic with episodic exacerbation (Parkman et al. 52 
2004).  T he idiopathic form of the  disorder , which  accounts for the greatest number of cases 53 
(Karamanolis et al. 2007), predominantly affects young adult females .  Gastroparesis i s also 54 
frequently associated with diabetes (diabetic gastroparesis),  which  likely occurs because of  55 
impaired neural control of gastric motility (Parkman et al. 2004).  In addition, acute 56 
hyperglycemia has the potential to slow gastric emptying and decrease  the effects of prokinetic 57 
drugs (Camilleri 2010).  58 
 59 
The core signs and symptoms of gastroparesis are nausea (92 to 96 percent ), vomiting (68  to 88 60 
percent ), postprandial fullness  (54 to 77 percent ), early satiety  (42 to 86 percent ), and upper 61 
abdominal pai n (36 to 85  percent ) (Hoogerwerf et al. 1999; Anaparthy et al. 2009) .  Patients may 62 
experience any combination of signs and symptoms  with varying degrees of severity.  Pain is 63 
more prevalent in patients with idiopathic gastroparesis than it is in patients with diabetic 64 
gastroparesis.   Patients with diabetic gastroparesis may experience further derangement of 65 
glucose control because of  unpredictable gastric emptying and altered absorption of orally 66 
administered hypoglycemic drugs . 67 
 68 
Because the signs and symptoms  of gastroparesis overlap with other gastrointestinal conditions, 69 
gastroparesis may be incorrectly diagnosed as bowel obstruction, functional dyspepsia, irritable 70 
bowel syndrome, or peptic ulcer disease .  In a patient with signs and symptoms sugges tive of 71 
gastroparesis,  a finding of DGE in the absence of an obstruction or alternative diagnosis  provides 72 
critical support for the diagnosis of gastroparesis and can be assessed using either gastric 73 
emptying scintigraphy, the gastric e mptying breath t est, or the SmartPill  motility testing system . 74 
 75 
There is an urgent medical need for development of safe and effective therapies t o treat patients 76 
with gastroparesis.  77

3 III. ENDPOINTS AND T RIAL DESIGN FOR GASTROPARESIS CLINICAL 79 
TRIALS  80 
 81 
Primary efficacy assessmen ts for adequate and well controlled trials must be well defined and 82 
reliable.5  Because gastroparesis is a symptomatic condition, a well-defined and reliable PRO 83 
instru ment that m easures all the clin ically important s igns and sy mptoms of gastroparesis would 84 
be the ideal p rimary efficacy -asses sment tool in clinical trials used to support labeling claim s for 85 
treating  gastroparesis .6  However, we are currently not aware of such a measure.  Until an 86 
appropriate PRO instru ment for gastroparesis becomes avail able, s ponsors should consider the 87 
strategies discussed in the following sections when designing gastroparesis  clinical tri als.  88 
Sponsors may also wish to review FDA ’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research Clinical 89 
Outcome Assessment (COA) Drug Development Tool Qualification Program web page  for 90 
information on qualified tools or tools currently under development. 91 
 92 
Sponsors may wish to include and evaluate well -defined PRO instruments assessing the relevant 93 
and important signs and symptoms in  early drug development  — and evaluate  the results in  94 
dose-ranging  phase 2  trials  or stand- alone noninterventional studies  — to support their future use 95 
in phase 3 trials .  We encourage early and regular discussions with FDA regarding the 96 
development of these  PRO instruments . 97 
 98 
Because gastroparesis manifests as more than one core sign or symptom, the effect of new drugs 99 
intended to treat gastroparesis on each core sign  and symptom should be assessed.  Early p hase 100 
trials shoul d help inform which of the core signs and/or symptoms should be included as 101 
prespecified endpoints intended to support labeling claims, based on which signs or symptoms 102 
the treatment is likely to improve.   It is important to show that even drugs intended t o treat only a 103 
subset of the core signs  or symptoms, based on the mechanism of the drug, do not worsen the 104 
remaining signs  or symptoms of gastroparesis.  For example, a drug may be expected to improve 105 
gastroparesis -related nausea and vomiting but not abdominal pain based on its mechanism of 106 
action.  In this scenario, clinical studies should demonstrate  that nausea and vomiting improved 107 
and that the treatment did not worsen  the symptoms of  abdominal pain, postprandial fullness, and 108 
early satiety . 109 
 110 
The following sections provide  recommendations  regarding  trial design , trial populations , 111 
outcome a ssessment measures, trial endpoints , and statistical considerations . 112 
 113 
A. Trial Design  114 
 115 
In general, t he trial design should consist of a rando mized, double -blind, placeb o-contr olled trial 116 
and s hould include a 1 - to 2-week screening period.  The  screening period can be used for 117 
investigators to establish the presence and persistence of tri al-entry criteria and for patients to 118 
gain experience completing the PRO instruments employed in the trial and demonstrate adequate 119

Support Labeling Claims .

4 understanding of and compliance with completing these instruments .  The screening period 120 
assessments of gastroparesis signs and symptoms can serve as the baseline values used in the 121 
analyses of the primary endpoint ( see section III.  D., Trial Endpoints).   FDA recommends a 122 
baseline assessment period of at least 7 days .  The primary  endpoint should measure the change 123 
in signs and symptoms from baseline  over a treatment period of at least 12 weeks’  duration.  124 
 125 
Trial designs should address the need for maintenance treat ment to prevent recurrence of s igns or 126 
symptom s. 127 
 128 
Endpoint  assessment  should be based on patients ’ daily reporting to avoid recall error,  and t he 129 
protocol should state whether rescue medication  (i.e., protocol -specified therapy for continued 130 
exacerbation of symptoms that is standardized across study sites)  is allowed.  Daily diaries 131 
should be collected throughout the entire trial.  132 
 133 
In addition, we recommend a  randomized, controlled , long- term safety study of 12 months’ 134 
duration, with appropriate prespecified provisions for rescue medications, which s hould be 135 
conducted before submitting a new drug application. 136 
 137 
B. Trial Populations  138 
 139 
Idiopathic and diabetic gastroparesis pa tients should be studied in separate clinical trials.  In 140 
general, diabetic gastroparesis patients experience the same core signs and symptoms a s patients 141 
with idiopathic gastroparesis,  but individual signs and symptoms may occur more often or with 142 
greater  severity in one population compared with the other , and the degree of diabetic control can 143 
also confound results.  To fully describe safety and efficacy in each p opulation, we recommend 144 
separate trials.  Because idiopathic and diabetic gastroparesis are closely related conditions, a 145 
single phase 3 trial  in each population with demonstrat ion of  reliable and clinically meaningful 146 
results may support  approval for both indications .7 147 
 148 
We recom mend that trial -entry crite ria include t he following:  149 
 150 
• The trial populations  should have a clinical diagnosis of idiopathic  or diabetic  151 
gastroparesis  (for the individual trials) based on a  documented history of gastroparesis 152 
symptoms, exclusion of other potential etiologies , and DGE (Abell et al. 2008; 153 
Parkman et al. 2004).  To optimize the ability to demonstrate a treatment effect , the 154 
trial should enroll patients with higher symptom severity (moderate to severe).  155 
Because there are currently no accepted definitions of gast roparesis  severity, the 156 
sponsor should provide a justification for the severity index selected, including what 157 
defines moderate and severe symptoms.  158 
 159 
• Diabetic gastroparesis patients should have controlled and stable blood glucose levels.  160 
Patients prone to  acute hyperglycemic events may confound interpretation of the 161 
therapeutic effect of the drug.  162

Product s (May 1998) . Contains Nonbinding Recommendations  
Draft — Not for Implementation  
5 • Patients on opioids should be excluded because o pioid use may affect  gastrointestinal 164 
motility  and potentially confound results . 165 
 166 
C. Approach for O utcome Assessment Measures  167 
 168 
Until a well- defined and reliable PRO instrument that measures all the clinically important signs 169 
and symptoms of gastroparesis is available, we recommend that the five core signs and 170 
symptoms of gastroparesis — nausea, vomiting, postprandial fullness, early satiety, and 171 
abdominal pain — be included as endpoints  in well -controlled clinical trials (Karamanolis et al. 172 
2007; Hoogerwerf et al. 1999; Anaparthy et al. 2009).  S ponsor s should identify and empirically 173 
justify the questionnaire items (and their wording) used to assess signs or  symptoms of 174 
gastroparesis that will be included in the trial.8 175 
 176 
Each sponsor should propose a primary endpoint definition ( see section III.  D. Trial Endpoints ) 177 
and a method for measuring each of the five signs  and symptoms  as described below .  Piloting 178 
the proposed instrument (s) in phase 2 trials can provide an opportunity to evaluate the ability o f 179 
the instrument (s) to detect change , provide guidelines for interpretation of clinically meaningful 180 
within -patient change , and confirm the endpoint definition.  Pilot results can further inform  plans 181 
for implementation of  the proposed instrument (s) in the phase 3 trials .  Wording of the 182 
questionnaire should be carefully thought out so the questions or requests do not overlap in their 183 
measurement concepts (e.g., postprandial fullness  and early satiety) , and the concepts should be 184 
well-defined  so that  they are  interpreted  in a consistent way by  patients (i.e., the questionnaire 185 
should include definitions for postprandial fullness , early satiety, or other terms that may vary in 186 
their interpretation among patients).  E ach core sign  and symptom should be separately measured 187 
and documented in the clinical trial.  188 
 189 
The sponsor should also specify the mode of data collection that will be used by patients  to 190 
record their daily sign s and symptom s (e.g., electronic diary ). 191 
 192 
All signs and symptoms except vomiting should be rated by severity.  For example , question or 193 
request  item responses can range from 0 for no symptom to 4 for the m ost severe symptom  194 
(0=none; 1=mild; 2=moderate; 3=severe; and 4=very severe ) or have a numerical rating scale 195 
from 0 to 10, where 0 reflects the absence of the symptom and 10 reflects  the worst possible 196 
symptom experience.  When possible, the rating scale should be consistent across the core s igns 197 
and symptoms .  We recommend that  reporting of vomiting  in a daily symptom diary be 198 
measured by frequency rather than severity.  Frequency should be reported as the exact number 199 
of times over a 24- hour period, and a clear definition of what is considered “one time” of 200 
vomiting should be provided to patients to ensure consistency both within and between patients 201 
in reporting the number of times vomiting has occurred.  The severity of nausea, postprandial 202 
fullness, early satiety, and abdominal pain should be recorded based on the patient ’s worst 203 
experience over a 24 -hour period.  204

6 D. Tria l Endpoints  206 
 207 
1. Primary Endpoint s 208 
 209 
Changes in patient -reported signs and symptom  scores should form the basis of the primary 210 
efficacy assessment in therapeutic trials for idiopathic and diabetic gastroparesis.  The primary 211 
endpoint should be based on patie nts’ core signs and symptoms or a subset of them.  Gastric 212 
emptying time should not be used as a primary efficacy endpoint because changes in gastric 213 
emptying time are not associated  with the changes in  the cli nically important s igns and 214 
symptoms in patients with gastroparesis.  215 
 216 
The primary  endpoint should measure change in signs and symptoms from baseline .  The 217 
analysis plan should include an evaluation of treatment effect throughout the 12- week study 218 
period.  219 
 220 
We recommend the use of an endpoint  that is based on core signs and symptoms .  This may be 221 
based on pre specified  core signs and symptoms or a symptom severity summary score 222 
(excluding vomiting) and vomiting frequency (collected as a continuous variable) .  The primary 223 
endpoint  should not be limited to a single sign or symptom.  If sponsors propose a summary 224 
score, they should evaluate question -level (or request- level) responses to determine whether 225 
individual questions (or requests)  overly influence the total score.  Currently , we do not have 226 
evidence to recommend one approach over the other .  Scores based on severity should be 227 
analyzed separately from those based on frequency (e.g., vomiting). 228 
 229 
2. Secondary /Other  Endpoints  230 
 231 
FDA recommends that changes from baseline in the individual signs and symptoms that are not  232 
assessed as part of the primary endpoint be measured as secondary endpoints.  Therefore, the 233 
primary and secondary endpoints should include  an evaluation  of all  five core signs and 234 
sympt oms.  Change in g astric emptying time can be measured as a secondary endpoint  if desired 235 
(Abell et al. 2008) .  The prespecified plan should address an analysis of the remaining core signs 236 
or symptoms that are not included in the primary endpoint . 237 
 238 
3. Defining Clinically Meaningful Within -Patient Changes in Sign and Symptom 239 
Scores  240 
 241 
To aid in the interpretation of the results, s ponsors should determine the amount of change that is 242 
meaningful to patients , in a total summary score or in individual sign and symptom scores .  243 
Ideally, this should be based on actual data and established in advance of phase 3 trials , so 244 
clinically meaningful within -patient change thresholds  may be prespecified.  There are two 245 
clinically meaningful change thresholds  of interest:  one for a clinically important improvement 246 
from baseline and one for a clinically important deterioration from baseline .  Depending on the 247 
proposed mechanism of action of the drug and trial  objectives, a proposed threshold  can spe cify 248 
some level of improvement i n each of the five core signs and symptoms, or it can spe cify some 249 
level of improvement i n a subset of those core signs and symptoms .  Worsening of core signs 250 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations  
Draft — Not for Implementation  
7 and symptoms would be inconsistent with the expected clinical benefit and taken into account 251 
when evaluating benefit and risk.  252 
 253 
We recommend the use of  an anchor -based approach , typically using phase 2 trial data , to 254 
estimate clinically meaningful change.  For this approach, we recommend including in phase 2 255 
and 3 trials  multiple anchor scales, such as patient  global impression of severity (PGIS) and 256 
patient global impression of change (PGIC) scales , with the intent of providing accumulated  257 
evidence to help interpret a clinically meaningfu l within -patient score change.  In contrast to a 258 
PGIC scale, a PGIS scale is not subject to recall error and can also be used to assess change from 259 
baseline data.  The PGIS scale is the preferred anchor scale over the PGIC scale; however, there 260 
is no perfe ct anchor scale, and it is helpful to include multiple anchor scales for anchor -based 261 
analyses.  262 
 263 
The following item , which could be asked of patients (following the assessment schedule and 264 
recall period of the prespecified endpoint) and at baseline, is an example of a  PGIS scale:  265 
 266 
“Please choose the response below that best describes the severity of your gastroparesis  267 
symptoms over the [insert appropriate recall period here] .” 268 
 269 
Sponsors can consider the following  response options  to this item :  0=none ; 1=mild; 270 
2=moderate; 3= severe; and 4= very s evere.  271 
 272 
The following item , which could be asked weekly of patients, is an example of a PGIC scale:  273 
 274 
“Please choose the response below that best describes the overall change in your 275 
gastroparesis  symptoms since you st arted taking the study medication.”  276 
 277 
Sponsors can consider the following  response options  to this item :  much better, a  little better, no 278 
change, a  little w orse, m uch w orse. 279 
 280 
Sponsors should determine the clinically meaningful within -patient change threshold range using 281 
anchor -based methods (e.g., patient global impression scale as an anchor), supplemented with 282 
empirical cumulative distribution function s (eCDF s) of within -patient score change.  Separate 283 
eCDF curves should be generated for each meaningful anchor category (e.g., improved, no 284 
change, worsened) using data pooled across trial arms.  285 
 286 
E. Statistical Considerations  287 
 288 
To evaluate  daily diary assessments created during  a trial , an adequate number of  the 289 
assessments should be available.  The sponsor can determine t his number based on evidence 290 
derived from the particular PRO assessment used in the trial.  For example, if a weekly summary 291 
score is used , in general, the sponsor should provide assessments fro m at least 4 of the 7 days .  292 
However,  evidence from a particular PRO  assessment  may support the need for  data from a 293 
higher number of days for that instrument  to provide r eliable results . 294 
 295 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations  
Draft — Not for Implementation  
8 The efficacy analysis plan should clearly define how patients who take rescue medication will be 296 
considered in the final analysis.  Sponsors also should propose met hods for handling missing 297 
data, including missing rescue medication data and missing PRO dat a at both question or request  298 
and instrument level s, in the analysis plan.  Sponsors  should consider d ifferent approaches  before 299 
the trial i s initiated and the properties of these approaches should be evaluated . 300 
 301 
We recommend that sponsors analyze the prim ary and secondary endpoints as continuous or 302 
ordinal variables ; we do not recommend the use of percent age change.  In general, a traditional 303 
responder analysis would not be appropriate unles s the targeted response is complete resolution  304 
of signs and symptoms .  In addition, w e encourage the  use of baseline values and other  305 
covariates to improve the efficiency of  primary and secondary endpoint analyses . 306 
 307 
Additionally, sponsor s should submit supportive descriptive analyses (i.e., graphs of eCDFs of 308 
within -patient change from baseline for primary and secondary endpoints  by treatment arm ) for 309 
FDA review. 310 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

This draft guidance, when finalized, will represent the current thinking of the Food and Drug 7 
Administration (FDA or Agency) on this topic.  It does not establish any rights for any person and is not 8 
binding on FDA or the public.  You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the 9 
applicable statutes and regulations.  To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible 10 
for this guidance as listed on the title page.  11

 13  14 I. INTRODUCTION  15 
 16 The purpose of this guidance is to assist sponsors in the clinical development of investigational 17 
drugs for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB)  under section 505 of the Federal Food, 18 
Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 355 and FDA regulations at 21 CFR part 312 19 
and part 601.
2  Specifically, this guidance provides the FDA’s  current recommendations 20 
regarding the overall development program for a new investigational drug or drugs to be used in 21 
combination with approved drugs or as a new treatment regimen that includes one or more 22 
investigational drugs to support an indication for the treatment of pulmonary TB .  This guidance 23 
does not address the development of drugs for latent TB infection or for extrapulmonary TB. 24 
 25 Sponsors should also refer to the guidance for industry  Codevelopment of Two or More New 26 
Investigational Drugs for Use in Combination (June 2013) .
3  Sponsors are encouraged to discuss 27 
with FDA the programs and pathways facilitating drug development that m ight be applicable for 28 
their development program.4  29 
 30 This guidance revises and replaces the draft guidance for industry of the same name issued in 31 
November 2013.  This revision includes more detail regarding nonclinical models, early phase 32 
studies, and trial design considerations, including the demonstration of efficacy using superiority 33 
or noninferiority (NI) trial designs.  Additionally, updates are made regarding inclusion of 34 
pediatric subjects in trials, endpoint and safety considerations, and labeling.  The Appendix 35 
containing the NI margin justification has also been updated. 36

This guidance does not contain discussion of the general issues of statistical analysis or clinical 38 
trial design.  Those topics are addressed in the International Council  for Harmonisation (ICH)  39 
guidances for industry E9 Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials  (September 1998) and E10 40 
Choice of Control Group and Related Issues in Clinical Trials  (May 2001)  (ICH E10) , 41 
respectively.  42 
 43 
In general, FDA’s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. 44 
Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only 45 
as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of 46 
the word sho uld in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but 47 
not required .  48

II. BACKGROUND  51 
 52 
Infections caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( M. tuberculosis ) are diagnosed  in the United 53 
States and are endemic  in many parts of the world.  Resistance to multiple drugs and coinfection 54 
with human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV)  pose challenges in the management of TB .  Drugs 55 
with new mechanisms of action,  impr oved safety profiles,  fewer drug- drug interactions, and 56 
treatment- shortening  combination  regimens are needed  to manage TB.   57 
 58 
 59 
III. DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM  60 
 61 
A. General Considerations 62 
 63 
1. Early Phase Clinical Development Considerations  64 
 65 
Nonclinical evaluations provide  valuable information for the development of investigational 66 
drugs  (see section III.C.1., Microbiology Considerations , section III.C.2.,  Relevant Nonclinical 67 
Safety Considerations , and section III.C.3., PK/PD  Considerations ).  68 
 69 
Activity of antimycobacterial drug s can be evaluated in trials of early bactericidal activity  (EBA)  70 
and/or in phase 2 trials that evaluate microbiologic al outcomes at early t ime points.   For a 71 
combination regimen , the sponsor should evaluate t he contribution of each drug to the treatment 72 
effect .5 This can be evaluated in phase 2 clinical development and in nonclinical studies (see 73 
section III.C.1., Microbiology Considerations ).  Treatment of pulmonary TB includes more than 74 
one drug in a treatment regimen, and sponsors may be developing more than one investigational 75 
drug as part of a new combination regimen .  Sponsors should consult with the Agency early in 76 
development regarding plans to demonstrate the contribution of the investigational drug(s) as 77 
part of a combination regimen.  78 
 79 
 
5 The recommendations in this guidance are relevant to demonstrating the contribution of the individual new 
investigational drugs to the effect(s) of the combination  regimen  and are consistent with the requirements of 21 CFR 
300.50, Fixed-combination prescriptio n drugs for humans.  Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 
Draft — Not for Implementation 
3 a. EBA  80 
 81 
If applicable to the investigational drug under study, EBA trials evaluating the quantitative 82 
counts of viable M.  tuberculosis  from daily collections of sputum can provide information on the 83 
bactericidal activity of antimycobacterial drugs .  These trials are intended to evaluate 84 
antimycobacterial activity  of investigational drugs alone or in combination  over a brief time 85 
course (e.g., 7 to 14 days).  EBA trials can provide preliminary evidence for the contribution of 86 
each drug to the treatment effect of the combination regi men.  Appropriate subjects for 87 
enrollment in  EBA trials include immunocompetent subjects , treatment- naïve adul t subject s at 88 
low risk of infect ion with drug- resistant TB, and subjects with no evidence of extra -pulmonary 89 
disease, who can begin standard- of-care treatment for pulmonary TB at the completion of the 90 
EBA trial.   91 
 92 
b. Phase 2 evaluations 93 
 94 Sponsors should conduct phase 2 trials to assess the antimycobacterial activity of a n 95 
investigational drug regimen .  In addition, if feasible , a phase 2 development program should 96 
include a dose ranging study or studies to assist in determining the most appropriate dose 97 
regimen to be taken into phase 3.  Phase 2 exploratory endpoints can include, but are not limited 98 
to, the following: (1) 8- week evaluation for  absence of acid -fast bacilli (AFB) in sputum; (2) 99 
time to sputum culture negativity for M.  tuberculosis; (3) symptom improvement; and/or (4) a 100 
biomarker intended to predict clinical benefit.  The Agency recommend s that as part of phase 2 101 
trial designs, sponsors include long- term follow -up with collection of clinical endpoints in 102 
addition to earlier time  points. 103 
 104 
2. Efficacy Considerations 105 
 106 An investigational drug can be evaluated for efficacy when added to combination re gimens of 107 
already  approved drugs.  Additionally, an entirely new combination regimen comprised of 108 
investigational drugs can be evaluated for efficacy.  A single adequate and well -controlled trial 109 
in subjects with pulmonary TB , support ed by other confirmatory evidence (e.g., evidence of 110 
antimycobacterial activity from nonclinical data, EBA, and p hase 2 trials), may  provide  evidence 111 
of effectiveness when the single trial demonstrate s a clinically meaningful and statistically robust 112 
treatment effect.
6  See section III., B., Specific Efficacy Trial Consideration, below for further 113 
discussion regarding efficacy considerations.  114 
 115 
3. Safety Considerations 116 
 117 The evaluation of the safety profile of an investigational drug can be challenging because 118 
patients with pulmonary TB  often have comorbid conditions.  Sponsors should evaluate potential 119 
drug- drug interactions that may occur during c oadministration with other antimycobacterial 120 
drugs or other concom itant medications  (e.g., antiretroviral drugs).   121 
 
6 See the draft guidance for industry Demonstrating  Substantial Evidence of Effectiveness for Human Drug and 
Biological Products  (December 2019).  When final, this guidance will represent the FDA’s current thinking on this 
topic.  For t he most recent version of a guidance, check the FDA guidance web page at 
https://www.fda.gov/regulatory -information/search -fda-guidance -documents . Contains Nonbinding Recommendations  
Draft —  Not for Implementation  
4  122 
Hepatotoxicity and QT interval prolongation are common adverse reactions with 123 
antimycobacterial drugs.  Sponsors should evaluate i nvestigat ional drugs for their potential to 124 
cause hepatotoxicity, QT prolongation, and arrhythm ias.7, 8  125 
 126 
Sponsors should discuss the  size of the preapproval safety database with the FDA during drug 127 
development.  For assessment of risks and benefits in subjects with an unmet medical need, a 128 
smaller safety database of approximately 300 subjects treated at (or greater/longer than) the 129 
proposed intended dose and duration may be sufficient . If safety signals are identi fied, a larger 130 
safety database may be needed.  131 
 132 
B. Specific Efficacy Trial Considerations 133 
 134 
1. Trial  Design s 135 
 136 
Sponsors can use t he following trial designs to demonstrate  superiority :  137 
 138 
• A regimen that includes one or more investigational drugs is compared to a standard 139 
regimen, with efficacy demonstrated by showing superiority of the investigational drug 140 
regimen over the standard regimen.9   141 
 142 
• The investigational drug (s) plus the optimized background regimen (OBR)  is compared 143 
to the matching placebo plus the OBR, with e fficacy demonstrated by showing 144 
superiority of the investigational  drug  regimen  over the placebo -containing regimen.  145 
Optimized  background antimycobacterial treatment  should be based on epidemiologic 146 
information and in vitro  susceptibility testing , when available.   147 
 148 
Sponsors can use t he following trial designs to demonstrate NI:  149 
 150 
• An investigational drug regimen is compared to a standard regimen.  NI  would be 151 
demonstrated by showing that the investigational regimen performs within a prespecified 152 
margin of the performance of the standard regimen.  153 
 154 
• The investigational drug replaces one of the drugs  in a st andard combination regimen .  155 
The investigational drug regimen should perform within an acceptable NI  margin that is  156 
based on the known quantitative and reliable contribution of the drug that has been 157

5 replaced  to the standard regimen.  This NI trial design determines the efficacy 158 
contribution of the investigational drug to the regimen.  159 
 160 
Interpretation of the results of an NI trial relies on a justified NI margin.  This margin , which is 161 
highly dependent on the specific design of the NI  trial, including the control regimen , is based , in 162 
part, on data f rom previously conducted trials  to evaluate for  historical e vidence of s ensitivity to 163 
drug e ffects  (HESDE) and estimate the effect of the active control .10  The Appendix contains  an 164 
example of a n NI margin justification for a trial of a 4-month regimen for drug- susceptible TB .   165 
 166 
The FDA has not estimated  an exact numerical treatment effect for the standard regimen of 2 167 
months of treatment with ethambutol, isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide followed by 4 168 
months of treatment with isoniazid and rifampin (abbreviated terminology : 2EHRZ/4HR)  for 169 
patients wi th drug- susceptible pulmonary TB .  However, considering the historical data on 170 
management and outcomes of patients with pulmonary TB in the era before antibacterial drug 171 
therapy and the highly successful results following treatment with 2EHRZ/4HR, there is  support 172 
for the selection of an NI margin based on the large degree of clinical benefit .  For example, 173 
given that  the success rates of 2EHRZ/4HR exceed 90 percent , the numerical treatment effect is 174 
likely to far exceed 10 percent  (Nahid et al . 2016 ).  The refore, based on clinical judgement, a 1 0 175 
percent  NI margin is clinically relevant  and has appropriate preservation of the treatment effect  176 
for an NI trial to determine the efficacy of a n investigational drug regimen as a whole based on 177 
comparison to this 6-month standard regimen .  178 
 179 
Depending on the new investigational drug regimen, study design of the NI trial, potential impact 180 
(e.g., ability to fulfill  an unmet medical need ), and safety profile of the regimen, it may be 181 
appropriate to set a wider NI  margin  and still plan for a trial design that is feasible and provides a 182 
reasonable preapproval safety database.  The Agency en courages s ponsors to  discuss their 183 
clinical trial designs and NI margin justification s with the FDA.11 184 
 185 
For both superiority trials and NI  trials that assess the activity of the investigational drug regimen 186 
as a whole, the sponsor will also need to address the added contribution of the components of the 187 
regimen .9  This  may be accomplished through nonclinical trials, EBA studies, phase 2 trials 188 
and/or as part of the pivotal efficacy trials.  189 
 190 
2. Trial  Populati on 191 
 192 
The trial population should include adult  subjects and if appropriate , pediatric subjects with 193 
pulmonary TB.  The presence of extrapulmonary disease may require longer durations of 194 
treatment than pulmonary TB and assessment of endpoints that evaluate t he extrapulmonary 195 
site(s).  Trials can include subjects with either drug- susceptible or drug -resistant pulmonary TB 196 
depending on the anticipated effectiveness of the antimycobacterial drugs being evaluated.  197 
 198 
 
10 See ICH E10 for a discussion of HESDE.  
 
11 See also the article Four -Month Moxifloxacin- Based Regimens for Drug -Sensitive Tuberculosis  (Gillespie et al. 
2014) . Contains Nonbinding Recommendations  
Draft —  Not for Implementation  
6 Protocols should specify how subjects will be handled after  in vitro  susceptibility results are 199 
available, both in the conduct of the trial  and in the analysis of the  results.  200 
 201 
Enrichment strategies regarding trials for  drug -resistant TB  can include a focus on contacts of 202 
subjects with drug- resistant TB , subjects from areas with a high prevalen ce of drug resistance, 203 
subjects who  relaps e after previous treatment, and subjects with disease progression on a 204 
standard regimen.   205 
 206 
3. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  207 
 208 
The FDA r ecommend s the following inclusion criteria for subjects with pulmonary TB : 209 
 210 
• Presence of AFB in  a sputum specimen detected by smear microscopy or other  rapid 211 
diagnostic test .  Microbiological diagnosis of TB  should be confirmed by culture from at 212 
least one sputum sample obtained at the time of enrollment.  213 
 214 
• Chest radiograph ic findings consistent with active pulmonary TB , for example , cavitary 215 
lesions, apical or other infiltrates, or hilar lymphadenopathy.  216 
 217 
• A minimum of two of the following signs or symptoms that have been present for at least 218 
2 weeks:  219 
 220 
 Sputum production  221 
 222 
 Cough 223 
 224 
 One or more episodes of hemoptysis  225 
 226 
 Fever (e.g., oral temperature greater than or equal to 38.0 degrees Celsius on at least 227 
two occasions)  228 
 229 
 Pleuritic chest pain  230 
 231 
 Weight loss  232 
 233 
 Night sweats 234 
 235 
Use of rapid diagnostic or nonculture tests may help identify a subject for enrollment in a  TB 236 
trial.  If the tests being  used are not FDA cleared, sponsors should provide sufficient information 237 
about the performance characteristics of the tests determined from analytical validation studies.  238 
 239 
The FDA r ecommend s the following  as exclusion criteria  for subjects  with pulmonary TB : 240 
 241 
• One or more weeks  of therapy for the current episode of active TB  (unless being enrolled 242 
in a trial targeting drug- resistant TB  and there is documented lack of response to therapy 243 
based on clinical and microbiological findings)  244 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations  
Draft —  Not for Implementation  
7  245 
• Signif icant concurrent illness other than HIV (e.g., lung cancer ) that may affect outcome 246 
assessment  247 
 248 
• Unwilling ness to comply with recommendations from local public health authorities for 249 
the management of patients with pulmonary TB  250 
 251 
4. Randomization, Stratification, and Blinding  252 
 253 
Trials should be randomized and double -blind  unless a sponsor can provide a scientifically 254 
adequate explanation why blinding cannot be accomplished.  If trials are single  blind or open 255 
label, sponsors should discuss potential biases with the FDA and how these biases will be 256 
addressed.   If the trial cannot be fully blinded, the sponsor should maintain the maximum 257 
possible level of blinding with in the trial with blinded assessors, blinded databases until database 258 
lock, etc.  259 
 260 
Sponsors should consider s tratification of subjects  based on certain baseline characteristics (e.g., 261 
by the presence or absence of cavitary disease, HIV infection ).  The sponsor should include in 262 
the protocol a discussion of how the analyses will account for the stratified randomization.12 263 
 264 
5. Specific  Populations  265 
 266 
a. Pediatric populations  267 
 268 
The FDA encourages sponsors to begin discussions about their pediatric clinical development 269 
plans as early as is feasible.  The additional safeguards of 21 CFR part 50, subpart D, for 270 
enrolling children in cl inical investigations, affect the timing and design of trials that support 271 
pediatric drug development.  In accordance with these requirements, sponsors can enroll 272 
pediatric subjects in trials if sufficient safety , antimycobacterial activity , pharmacokineti c (PK) , 273 
and efficacy  data in adult  subject s are available and appropriate dosing regimens  for pediatric 274 
subjects  have been characterized.13  Sponsors can include a dolescent  subject s with pulmonary 275 
TB in phase 3 clinical trials, if appropriate.14 276 
 277 
Sponsors must  submit pediatric study plans  no later than 60 calendar days after the date of the 278 
end-of-phase 2 meeting  or an other time as agreed upon by the FDA and the sponsor  unless the 279

8 investigational drug has been  granted  an orphan designation.15  Pedi atric formulation 280 
development should begin as soon as results from the adult phase 2b trials are known and the 281 
sponsor has determined an appropriate dosing regimen.  282 
 283 
Extrapolation of adult efficacy for the treatment of pulmonary TB to pediatric populations is 284 
acceptable for most pediatric populations, with the exception of  very young children, who have 285 
different clinical and pathophysiologic characteristics.  Sponsors should provide PK and safety 286 
information in a sufficient number of pediatric subjects to support the appropriate dose for 287 
treatment of children with pulmonary TB.  Cohorts for pediatric studies can be defined based on 288 
chronological age or weight- based criteria, particularly for oral drugs.  Studies of drugs across 289 
the pediatric spectrum of ages/weights can be conducted in parallel rather than sequentially 290 
unless there are specific safety or PK properties that warrant a different approach.   If existi ng 291 
animal studies have identified potential developmental concerns for target organs (toxicology or 292 
pharmacology), juvenile animal toxicity testing may be appropriate .16, 17 293 
 294 Pediatric development plans for new TB investigational drugs could include children living with 295 
HIV provided there are no safety or drug -drug interaction issues  that cannot be managed .  296 
 297 Sponsors should discuss their  pediatric development programs with the FDA,  especially if they 298 
include very young children (e.g., those younger than 5 years of age) because of  differences in 299 
clinical manifestations (e.g., increased likelihood of extrapulmonary disease) and 300 
pathophysiologic characteristics.  301 
 302 
b. Pregnant females 303 
 304 
Sponsors can include pregnant females in clinical trials once all female reproduction toxicity 305 
studies and the standard battery of genotoxicity tests have been conducted.
18  Infants born to 306 
female subjects  who received the investigational drug(s) should be followed by investigators for 307 
an appropriate length  of time; sponsors should discuss the duration with the FDA before trial 308 
conduct.19   309 
 
15 See section 505B (e)(2)(A)  of the FD&C Act  (21 U.S.C. 355 c(e)(2)(A)).  For additional information, see the 
guidance for industry Pediatric Study Plans: Content of and Process for Submitting Initial Pediatric Study Plans

17 We support the principles of the 3Rs (reduce, refine, and replace) for animal use in testing when feasible.  We 
encourage sponsors to consult with the review division  when considering  using  a nonanimal testing method they 
believe is su itable, adequate, validated, and feasible.  We will consider if such an alternative method could be 
assessed for equivalency to an animal test method.

9  310 
c. Other spe cific populations  311 
 312 
Sponsors should include in trials geriatric  subjects,20 subjects with renal insufficiency, diabetes 313 
mellitus, and subjects  with hepatic impairment, if feasible .  Because of the high incidence of TB  314 
in patients coinfected with HIV, subjects with HIV should be included in trials .   315 
 316 
6. Dose Selection  317 
 318 
When selecting a dosing regimen to be evaluated in phase 3 clinical trials, sponsors should 319 
consider target PK/pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters (e.g., area under the curve/minimum 320 
inhibitory concentration (MIC), maximal concentration /MIC, time above the MIC) based on 321 
in vitro models  (see s ection III. C.1.a ., In vitro studies ) and animal models  of TB , results from 322 
early clinical trials (e.g., EBA and/or trials of AFB clearance from sputum at early time points), 323 
and results from exposure -response evaluations .  PK/PD evaluations should include evaluations 324 
based on free drug concentrations . 325 
 326 
7. Choice of Comparators  327 
 328 
The choice of comparator or background regimen depends in part on the subject population that 329 
the sponsor will enroll in the trial (e.g., the likelihood of infection with drug- susceptible or drug - 330 
resistant M.  tuberculosis ).  In ge neral, sponsors should choose comparator regimens that contain 331 
FDA- approved drugs and repr esent standard  of care.   Before trial initiation, s ponsors should 332 
discuss with the FDA t he use of comparator regimens based on local practice outside of the 333 
United St ates, or the use of drugs that are not FDA -approved.  334 
 335 
8. Efficacy Endpoints  336 
 337 
Sponsors can use t he following efficacy endpoints in clinical trials of investigational drugs 338 
intended to treat pulmonary TB : 339 
 340 
• A primary clinical efficacy endpoint that is comprised of survival and evaluation of 341 
M. tuberculosis growth on serial sputum culture examinations at a fixed time  point 342 
following randomization for all treatment arms and includes  a period of follow -up 343 
after completion of the planned treatment period.   The FDA defines c linical success 344 
and failure as follows:  345 
 346 
Clinical success is assigned to subjects who are alive, achieved M. tuberculosis  culture 347 
negativity on serial sputum examinations, did not experience relapse or recurrence of 348 
pulmonary TB, and otherwise did not meet a definition of clinical failure.  In general, 349 
 
20 See the ICH guidances for industry E7 Studies in Support of Special Populations:  Geriatrics  (August 1994) and 
E7 Studies in Support of Special Populations:  Geriatrics :  Questions and Answers  (February 2012) . Contains Nonbinding Recommendations  
Draft —  Not for Implementation  
10 protocol -defined serial sputum examinations should occur every 2 weeks or once a month 350 
during treatment, and every 3 months following completion of treatment.21 351 
 352 
Clinical failure  is defined as having one or more of the following:  353 
 354 
 Protocol -defined clinical progression of pulmonary disease during treatment  355 
 356 
 Switch in antimycobacterial therapy because of  tolerability issues or clinical 357 
progression of pulmonary TB  358 
 359 
 Signs or symptoms of active TB, including radiographic worsening compared to 360 
baseline findings, resulting in reinitiation of antimycobacterial thera py during 361 
follow -up22 362 
 363 
 Death during treatment or follow -up 364 
 365 
 Growth of M.  tuberculosis on sputum culture outlined as follows : 366 
 367 
 Failure to achieve M. tuberculosis  culture  negativity in serial sputum specimens 368 
during the treatment period 369 
 370 
 Failure to maintain culture negative status a fter a specific time point defined in 371 
the trial (in general, this is expected to be any time after two consecutive negative  372 
sputum cultures, taken at least 28 days apart) on therapy or in follow -up 373 
 374 
 Any growth of M.  tuberculosis  from an extrapulmonary site during the trial  375 
 376 
• A surrogate  endpoint based on results of  M. tuberculosis sputum cultures during 377 
treatment .  Demonstration of treatment effect on sputum culture conversion from 378 
positive to negative  during treatment, either as a time -to-conversion analysis or at a fixed 379 
time point (e.g., at 2 months from randomization), could be considered as surrogate 380 
endpoints reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit under the accelerated approval 381 
statutory an d regulatory provisions .23  Additional considerations related to accelerated 382 
approval regarding verification and description of  clinical benefit , including the 383 
durability of the treatment effect are discussed in section III.B.11., Accelerated Approval 384 
Considerations .  Sponsors should obtain s erial cultures at specific time points during 385 
treatment (e.g., every 2 weeks or every month).  The time to sputum culture conversion is 386 
the time to the first sterile culture , verified by M. tuberculosis  culture negativity in at 387 
 
21 The protocol -defin ed timing of serial examinations of sputum for culture may differ from clinical practice, which 
often depends on local treatment guidelines and respiratory isolation procedures.   
 
22 In some circumstances , antimycobacterial therapy may be restarted though there is diagnostic uncertainty whether 
relapse has occurred, but therapy is subsequently stopped when an alternative diagnosis is established.  Protocols 
should define the duration of retreatment therapy that will be used to define clinical failure to avoid labeling all trial 
subjects  in this situation as failures.

11 least two subsequent consecutive sputum specimens taken at least 14 days apart  (e.g., 388 
three consecutive negative sputum culture s).  Sputum cultures can be evaluated on either 389 
solid or liquid media  (see section III.B.11., Accelerated Approval Considerations) .  390 
 391 
• Secondary  and exploratory endpoint s.  Sponsors should consider  the following : 392 
 393 
 A well -defined and reliable evaluation of symptoms , which can be included in the 394 
clinical  trial as a secondary or exploratory endpoint.  O f note, symptom evaluation in 395 
certain  patient populations may be more difficult to  interpret , for example, among 396 
patients  coinfected with HIV who experience immune reconstitution inflammatory 397 
syndrome  or non- HIV- infected individuals with paradoxical reactions (Rangaka et al . 398 
2012).  399 
 400 
 Molecular or other biochemical evaluations to ascertain whether a positive culture for 401 
M. tuberculosis after drug treatment represents relapse or reinfection (e.g. , an 402 
exploratory endpoint analysis that treat s relapse of the baseline M. tuberculosis  403 
infection as a failure  of the  original study treatment and treats reinfection with a new 404 
M. tuberculosis  isolate as a  success of the original study treatment ). 405 
 406 
9. Trial  Procedur es and Timing of Assessments  407 
 408 
a. Entry visit  409 
 410 
Sponsors should obtain baseline demographic information, current medications, and complete 411 
physical e xamination s at the entry visit.  In addition, sponsors should obtain the following at 412 
entry:  413 
 414 
• Clinical signs and symptoms of pulmonary TB  (e.g., cough, sputum production, episodes 415 
of hemoptysis, fever, pleuritic chest pain, weight loss, night sweats) . 416 
 417 
• Baseline safety laboratory evaluations . 418 
 419 
• HIV serology and, if HIV positive, viral load and  CD4 cell count . 420 
 421 
• Imaging results (standard posterior to anterior view and lateral chest radiographs or 422 
comput ed tomography scans ) describing the extent and severity of pulmonary disease . 423 
 424 
• Sputum specimens for AFB smears and mycobacterial culture obtained by one of the 425 
following: spontaneous expectoration, i nduction with hypertonic saline , bronchoscopy , or 426 
gastric lavage (e.g., for pediatric subjects).  When applicable, baseline specimens for 427 
quantitative cultures should be collected in a standardized manner (e.g., single early 428 
morning induced sputum , pooled 24- hour sputum) . 429 
 430 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations  
Draft —  Not for Implementation  
12 b. Visits during  therapy and after therapy completion 431 
 432 
In general, clinical assessments should occur weekly or biweekly during the first months of 433 
therapy, followed by monthly assessments until therapy completion.  After completion of 434 
therapy, assessments should occur approximately every 3 months until the assessment of the 435 
primary efficacy endpoint is complete (e.g., at 12 months  after randomization).  Ass essments of 436 
signs and symptoms, adverse effects, and laboratory tests, as appropriate, should occur at these 437 
visits.  In addition, targeted physical examinations should be performed.   438 
 439 
During therapy, sponsors should obtain s putum specimens for AFB smears and culture at least 440 
monthly.  Depending on the investigational drug regimen and design, a shorter interval between 441 
specimen collections (e.g., 2 weeks) may be appropriate for certain periods of the trial.   442 
 443 
If subjects are not able to expectorate sputum spontaneously at follow -up visits  after therapy 444 
completion , sponsors should consider other methods to obtain sputum  (e.g., sputum induction ). 445 
 446 
10. Statistical Considerations  447 
 448 
In general, the sponsor should include in the protocol  a detailed statistic al analysis plan stating 449 
the trial hypotheses and the efficacy analysis methods.   450 
 451 
Sponsors should consider t he following definitions of analysis populations:  452 
 453 
• Safety population:   all subjects who received at least one dose of the investigational 454 
drug during the trial . 455 
 456 
• Intent -to-treat (ITT)  population :  all randomized subjects . 457 
 458 
• Microbiological ITT (m icro-ITT)  population:   all randomized subjects  with a positive 459 
culture for M. tuberculosis from a pretreatment  prerandomization  sample.  For trials 460 
intended  to focus on subjects with drug- resistant TB, sponsors can  choose for the primary 461 
analysis  a micro -ITT population of all randomized subjects  with a  positive culture for  a 462 
drug- resistant isolate of M. tuberculosis in the  pretreatment prerandomization  sample.  463 
 464 
• Per-protocol  population:   all randomized subjects  with a positive culture from a 465 
pretreatment sample who achieve a prespecified level of compliance with the protocol 466 
(e.g., presence at all or a high percentage of follow -up visits ). 467 
 468 
In general, the analysis population of greatest interest in the determination of efficacy is the 469 
micro -ITT population.  In addition, sponsors should evaluate consistency of results for efficacy 470 
in the ITT and per -protocol populations.  If there are notable differences between outcomes for 471 
the ITT and per-protocol populations, the sponsor should investigate reasons for these 472 
differences.    473 
 474 
All subjects should be followed completely for the duration of the trial even if they discontinue 475 
the investigational drug (s).  Sponsors should make every effort to minimize the loss to follow -up 476 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations  
Draft —  Not for Implementation  
13 throughout the trial .  Given that missing data are nonetheless likely to occur, the protocol should 477 
state how missing data will be handled in the primary efficacy analysis.  Additional ly, the 478 
statistical analysis plan should define additional methods for handling missing data.  The study 479 
report should include a n assessment of t he dependence of the trial results on the specific method 480 
for handling missing data. 481 
 482 
To improve the precision of treatment effect estimation and inference, sponsors should consider 483 
adjusting for prespecified baseline factors that are anticipated to be pro gnostic of the outcome.  If 484 
randomization is stratified by baseline covariates, the analysis should account for the stratified 485 
randomization. 486 
 487 
11. Accelerated Approval Considerations  488 
 489 
In some circumstances, approval under 21 CFR part 314, subpart H , or 21 CFR part 601, subpart 490 
E, may be applicable to drugs developed for the treatment of TB that provide clinically 491 
meaningful benefit over existing treatments.   An endpoint based on conversion of sequential 492 
M. tuberculosis sputum cultures to negative  (e.g., percent conversion at a prespecified time 493 
point) can be used as a surrogate endpoint  that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit 494 
(Wallis et al. 2010; Wallis et al. 2013; Phillips et al. 2013; Wallis, Peppard, and Hermann  2015; 495 
Wallis and Pepp ard, 2015; Phillips et al. 2016; Meyvisch  et al. 2018) .  A sponsor may consider 496 
other surrogate endpoint s (e.g., biomarker s) that are also  reasonably likely to predict clinical 497 
benefit.  When a drug is approved under accelerated approval, FDA will require that the sponsor  498 
“study the drug further, to verify and describe its clinical benefit”24 including the durability of 499 
the treatment effect .  Sponsors considering sputum culture conversion or other surrogate 500 
endpoints that are reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit should consult with  the Agency as 501 
the clinical trial is being planned.  502 
 503 
C. Other Considerations  504

1. Microbiological Considerations  506 
 507 
Sponsors of i nvestigational drugs being evaluated for the treatment of TB  should have supportive 508 
data from in vitro  and in vivo ( animal model ) microbiological studies.  These studies may  509 
provide data to inform selection of the regimen of antimycobacterial drugs to be evaluated in 510 
clinical trials  and to assess the contribution of each drug to the investigational drug regimen . 511 
 512 
a. In vitro  studies  513 
 514 
In vitro  studies should encompass the following:  515 
 516 
• Investigations of drug activity ( inhibiting growth or killing ) against metabolically active, 517 
dormant, and intracellular stages of M. tuberculosis .   518 
 519 
 
24 21 CFR 314.510 for drugs and 21 CFR 601.41 for biological products.  Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 
Draft — Not for Implementation 
14 • Susceptibility testing against metabolically active bacilli from drug -susceptible laboratory 520 
strains , laboratory strains with known patterns of drug resistance, and clin ical isolates 521 
representing different geographical regions.  522 
 523 
• Standardized methods for susceptibility testing such as those recommended by the 524 
Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI).25   525 
 526 • If nonstandard methods are being employed in the trial, prior submission for FDA review 527 
of a complete description of the methods and the performance characteristics of the assay 528 
in the actual laboratory where testing will be done.     529 
 530 • Establishment of q uality control parameters for susceptibility testing  before  531 
determination of in vitro activity .
26   532 
 533 
If two or more new investigational drugs are under evaluation simultaneously, the sponsor 534 
should conduct factorial design  studie s evaluating the new investig ational drugs and provide the 535 
results to the FDA.9  The FDA encourages t esting against multiple strains of M. tuberculosis .  536 
See section  III.C.3.d., In vitro hollow fiber system models , for methods of assessment of the 537 
contribution of individual drugs in a combination regimen. 538 
 539 
b. In vivo ( animal models ) 540 
 541 
Appropriate animal models can serve as an important bridge between the identification of 542 
in vitro  antimycobacterial effects of an investigational drug and the initiation of clinical trials.  543 
PK assessments and changes in drug susceptibility in animal model studies may inform clinical 544 
trial designs.  Sponsors should consider evaluations of the investigational drug, and/ or 545 
combinations of investigational drugs, using different animal mode ls and more than one 546 
strain/isolate of M.  tuberculosis  to study mycobacterial burden and sterilizing activity.  In vivo 547 
studies conducted using a factorial design using clinically relevant exposures can provide 548 
information on the contribution of the individual drugs to the  combination regimen.  549 
 550 
c. Drug resistance and cross- resistance  551 
 552 
Sponsors should examine the pot ential of M. tuberculosis  isolates to develop resistance to the 553 
investigational drug in appropriate in vitro  and/or animal  models and should evaluate the 554 
potential for cross -resistance to drugs in the same class or in other classes  used for the treatment 555 
of TB .  If resistance is demonstrated, it is important to identify the mechanism(s)  of resistance.  556 
 
25 For examples, s ee the guidance for industry and FDA  Class II Special Controls Guidance Document:  
Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems  (August 2009) and CLSI ’s Susceptibility Testing of  Mycobacteria, 
Nocardiae, and Other Aerobic Actinomycetes; Approved Standard — Third Edition , (available at 
https://clsi.org/standards/products/microbiology/documents/m24/ ).  For the most recent version of a class II special 
controls guidance document, check the FDA class II special controls guidance document web page at

Development, Analysis, and Presentation  (February 2018) .  Contains Nonbinding Recommendations  
Draft —  Not for Implementation  
15 Sponsors should attempt  to evaluate the clinical significance of any changes in phenotype (e.g., 557 
in vitro  susceptibility to the investigational drug) or genotype observed in nonclinical studies by 558 
correlating such changes with efficacy outcomes.  559 
 560 
d. Types of culture media  to identify M. tuberculosis  561 
 562 
Solid media (e.g., Löwenstein -Jensen  medium, Middlebrook 7H10 or 7H11 agar media) and 563 
liquid media (e.g., myco bacteria growth indicator tube) are culture assay methods used to 564 
identify and characterize M. tuberculosis .  Sponsors can include other  newer molecular 565 
methodologies  to detect M. tuberculosis  and its susceptibility profile in trials for microbiological 566 
evaluations .  Sponsors should specify the methods used to culture and identify M. tuberculosis  as 567 
well as the in vitro  susceptibility testing methods  that will be employed  in the trial.   568 
 569 
For baseline evaluations, the Agency recommend s using both solid and liquid media.  The 570 
advantages to this approach are (1) more rapid observation of mycobacterial growth in liquid 571 
media (e.g., less than 2 weeks)  and (2) that growth of pure culture on solid media is already 572 
underway for (a) the biochem ical confirmation of M. tuberculosis  and ( b) the evaluation of in 573 
vitro susceptibility.   574 
 575 
For the evaluation of subjects on treatment and aft er treatment completion , sponsors can use 576 
solid or liquid culture media .  Within a clinical trial, the culture meth odologies among trial sites 577 
should be consistent to evaluate all subjects in the trial.   Other types of culture evaluations can be 578 
informative as secondary or exploratory endpoints (e.g., quantitative culture techniques).   579 
 580 
e. Differentiate relapse from reinfection or new infection  581 
 582 
As a secondary analysis, sponsors should  aim to utilize mole cular methods to evaluate whether 583 
clinical failure is caused by relapse of the original infection or by development of a new 584 
infection , especially in subjects living in endemic areas.  If any of these methods are used in a 585 
clinical trial, the sponsor shoul d include details of the methods used as well as performance 586 
characteristics of all assays in the clinical protocol.  587 
 588 
2. Relevant Nonclinical Safety Considerations  589 
 590 
Combination regimens  remain the standard of care  for the treatment of TB.  Individual drugs 591 
may be developed for treatment of active disease although they would be used as part of a 592 
combination regimen .  Nonclinical studies to characterize the safety profile of individual drugs 593 
or a combination regimen and to support clinical trials and approval of a marketing application 594 
will vary, depending on the information available on each drug and the intended patient 595 
population.27  The Agency encourage s sponsors to discuss with the FDA the available toxicology 596 
 
27 For guidance on when to conduct nonclinical combination studies to support clinical trials of combination  
regimen s, see the following: (1) guidance for industry Nonclinical Safety Evaluation of Drug or Biologic 
Combinations  (March 2006) ; (2) ICH guidance  for industry M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of 
Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals ; (3) ICH guidance for industry S6(R1) 
Preclinical Safety Evaluation of Biotechnology -Derived Pharmaceuticals  (May 2012) ; and (4) guidance for industry 
Codevelopment of Two or More New Investigational Drugs for Use in Combination.  Contains Nonbinding Recommendations  
Draft —  Not for Implementation  
16 data for each investigational drug an d a proposal for the clinical development of the combination 597 
regimen . 598 
 599 
Sponsors should conduct nonclinical toxicology studies of a combination regimen consisting of  600 
two or more investigational (unapproved) drugs before initial administration of that combination 601 
regimen to humans based on the following:  602 
 603 
• The availability  of clinical experience with the individual drugs  604 
 605 
• The availability  of relevant nonclinical toxicology data for each of the individual drugs 606 
for the proposed duration of the combination regi men 607 
 608 
• The existence of a significant toxicological concern and the safety margin between the no 609 
observed adverse effects level (NOAEL) for each of the individual drugs in the animal 610 
toxicology studies and the proposed human exposure to each of the investigational drugs 611 
in the combination regimen  612 
 613 
• The potential for drug -drug interaction s based on the absorption, distribution, 614 
metabolism, and excretion of each of the drugs  615 
 616 
• The potential for adverse effects to involve the same organ system ( overlapping 617 
toxicities ) or synergistic toxicities based on a review of accumulated data from each of 618 
the investigational drugs  619 
 620 
Sponsors  should discuss with  the FDA the  type, duration, and timing of  nonclinical toxicology 621 
studies needed to support clinical developme nt of the combination  regimen .  622 
 623 
3. PK/PD Considerations  624 
 625 
a. Phase 1/ phase 2 PK trials  626 
 627 
The PK  of the investigational drug should be fully characterized in single -dose PK, multiple - 628 
dose PK, and phase 2 PK/PD evaluations .  The FDA recommends characterization of PK in 629 
specific populations, including subjects who have renal or hepatic impairment, as well as an 630 
evaluation of the drug effect on the QT interval .28  631 
 632 
b. Drug interactions  633 
 634 
Sponsors should conduct i n vitro studies to determine the pote ntial of the investigational drug to 635 
act as a substrate, inhibitor , or inducer of major human metabolizing enzymes  and relevant 636 
transporters .29  Based on these results, drug interaction evaluations  between one or more of the 637

Potential for Non -Antiarrhythmic Drugs  — Questions and Answers  (R1) (October 2012) . 
 
29 See the guidance for industry In Vitro Drug Interaction Studies — Cytochrome P450 Enzyme - and Transporter -
Mediated Drug Interactions  (January 2020).  Contains Nonbinding Recommendations  
Draft —  Not for Implementation  
17 antimycobacterial drugs used in the planned combination regimen, or with  drugs unrelated to the 638 
treatment of TB but likely to be used concomitantly for other indications  (e.g., antiretroviral 639 
therapy for treatment of HIV; antiviral therapy for treatment of hepatitis B or C ), may be needed 640 
before initiating clinical efficacy trials.30  The Agency strongly recommends that sponsors 641 
consult the FDA during drug development regarding appropriate drug interaction evaluations .  642 
 643 
c. Exposure  response  644 
 645 
Sponsors should explore e xposure -response relationships during early phases of drug 646 
development to aid in the selection of optimal dosing strategies for evaluation in later trials.31  647 
The FDA encourages sponsors to explore exposure -response  relationships for both sputum and 648 
serum drug concentrations and markers of activity (e.g., the time -to-sputum -conversion or 649 
sputum conversion rate at 2 months in subjects  with pulmonary TB ). 650 
 651 
d. In vitro hollow fiber system models  652 
 653 
The re sults from hollow fiber system models, combined with other sources of nonclinical data, 654 
can help inform the selection of antimycobacterial drug regimens to begin clinical evaluation 655 
(Chilukuri  et al. 2015).  The hollow fiber system models can be used to si mulate PK  656 
characteristics of drugs intended to treat TB and allows for the exploration of concentration- 657 
effect relationships potentially relevant to the treatment of TB  in the clinical setting.  T hese 658 
models are expected to provide key information on regim en selection for further evaluation.  659 
These models may also play an important role in evaluating the contribution of each drug (at 660 
clinically relevant exposures) to the treatment effect . 661 
 662 
4. Foreign Clinical Data32 663 
 664 
FDA regulations permit the acceptance of foreign clinical trials in support of a new drug 665 
application (NDA)  or biologics license application (BLA)  approval  (21 CFR 312.120).   666 
 667 
5. Data standards for TB  668 
 669 
Study data standards describe a standard ized way to exchange clinical and nonclinical research 670 
data between computer systems.  Data standards have been developed for TB to provide a 671

Mediated Drug Interactions  (January 2020).

Applications  (April 2003) .

Draft — Not for Implementation 
18 consistent general framework for organizing study data, including templates for datasets, 672 
standard names for variables, and standard ways of doing calculations with common variables.33   673 
 674 
6. Labeling Considerations 675 
 676 
Generally, the labeled indication should reflect the patient population enrolled in the clinical 677 
trials.  For example , sponsors should consider the following : 678 
 679 
Drug X is indicated in combination with Drugs Y and Z for the treatment of pulmonary 680 
tuberculosis. 681 
 682 
or  683 
 684 
Drug X is indicated in combination with other antimycobacterial drugs  for the treatment 685 
of pulmonary tuberculosis.  686 
 687 For drugs approved under accelerated approval, the sponsor must include additional information 688 
in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE  section (see 21 CFR 201.57(c)(2)(i)(B)).
34  For drugs 689 
approved  under the l imited population pathway for a ntibacterial and antifungal drugs, additional 690 
information is available for specific labeling requirements and recommendations.35, 36691

21 APPENDIX 771 
Example of a Justification for a Noni nferiority Margin  772 
in a Treatment -Shortening Clinical Trial of Pulmonary Tuberculosis  773 
 774 
This appendix provides an example of a noninferiority (NI) margin justification.  As stated in 775 
this guidance, NI  margin  justification s are dependent on the specific design of the NI  trial.  This 776 
justification is for a specific NI  trial that w ould compare a n investigational drug  regimen 777 
consisting of a new investigational drug plus the first 4 months of the standard regimen to the 778 
standard  6-month regimen in subjects with drug -susceptible tuberculosis ( TB).  The effect of the 779 
investigational drug essentially replaces the effect of Months 5 and 6 of the standard regimen.  780 
Using historical data, t his justification  determines the effect of these 2 months of therapy 781 
(historical evidence of sensitivity to drug e ffects  (HESDE )) to de termine if the new 782 
investigational drug is effective based on the results of the NI  trial.  Additional information is 783 
available regarding a complete discussion of NI  trials and justification s of margins .1 784 
 785 We identified two  trials that allowed for an esti mate of the effect of M onths 5 and 6 in the 786 
standard regimen for drug -susceptible TB , based on a comparison of the standard-of- care 787 
regimen (2 months of treatment with ethambutol (or streptomycin), isoniazid, rifampin, and 788 
pyrazinamide followed by 4 months of treatment with isoniazid and rifampin, which is often 789 
described in abbreviated terminology as 2EHRZ/4HR or 2SHRZ/4HR ) to a 4- month regimen  of 790 
2EHRZ/2HR  or 2SHRZ/2HR.
2  The endpoint of unfavorable outcome was defined as one of the 791 
following: (1)  subjects who never become sputum culture negative for M. tuberculosis  while on 792 
therapy; (2) subjects who had microbiological confirmation of relapse of pulmonary TB within a 793 
12-month period of observation following therapy completion; or (3) subjects who died at any 794 
time within the clinical trial drug administration period and 12-month period of observation 795 
following therapy completion. 796 
 797 Table A , below, contains the results from the two trials  among subjects randomized to receive 798 
the 6- month regimen or the 4- month regimen .  A comparison of the two regimens gives an 799 
estimate of the effect of the final 2 months of the 6 -month regimen of 8.4 percent with a lower 800 
bound of the 95 percent confidence interval of 4.8 percent; 4.8 percent can be used as a 801 
conservative estimate of the treatment effect of Months 5 and 6 of treatment.  802

In an NI  trial in subjects with drug- susceptible pulmonary TB  where a tr eatment -shortening 822 
regimen is compared to a standard 6-month regimen, the selection of a n NI margin of 4.8 percent  823 
can be supported by the historical data .  The NI  margin  justification presented here is a 824 
modification of the justification presented in Nunn et al . 2008 .3   825 
 826 
Although an NI  margin of 4.8 percent may seem over ly conservative, the fact that a very high 827 
proportion of subjects achieve a successful primary efficacy outcome with standard of care 828 
provides for a reasonable estimate o f the sample size for  an NI  trial.  Additionally, given the high 829 
proportion of subjects achieving a successful outcome, there is interest in maintaining this high 830 
proportion in new investigational drug regimens.  For example, we identified a trial (Johnson et 831 
al. 2009)4 that described halting of the trial by a data monitoring committee based on an 832 
approximately 5 percentage point estimate difference between the standard regimen and a 833 
treatment- shortening regimen, indicating that there is a clinical expecta tion that there should be a 834 
high proportion of subjects achieving successful outcome s in both treatment groups, making the 835 
selection of a n NI margin of 4.8 percent a feasible consideration.   836

follow ing assumptions: (1) the identification of Mycobacterium tuberculosis  in 90 percent  of 841 
enrolled subjects (primary analysis population is approximately 430 subjects per arm); (2) a two - 842 
sided type I error of 0.05 and power of 90 percent ; (3) for both arms, a  rate of 5  percent  of 843 
subjects who have the endpoint of failure to convert to negative sputum cultures , or who 844 
experience relapse of TB , or death at a 12 -month period of observation; and (4) an NI  margin of 845 
4.8 percent . 846

Sponsors should discuss with the FDA appropriate NI  margins for specific NI  trials being 848 
proposed.  849

 Allergic Rhinitis:   
Developing Drug  Products  for Treatment  
Guidance for Industry1 
 
  
 
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) on 
this topic.  It does not establish any right s for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public.  You 
can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations.  
To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA office responsible for this gui dance as listed on the 
title page.   
 
   
I. INTRODUCTION 
 
The purpose of t his guidance is to assist sponsors in the development of  drug  products for the 
treatment of allergic rhinitis in children and adults.
2  The guidance addresses issues of trial 
design, effectiveness, and safety for new products being developed for the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) and perennial allergic rhinitis (PAR).  
 The recommendations in this guidance are based on an assessment of important issues raised in the revi ew of both adult and pediatric allergic rhinitis clinical trials and the Agency’s current 
understanding of the mechanism of the two related disorders of SAR and PAR.  The pathophysiology of SAR and PAR are similar in terms of the chemical mediators produce d and 
end-organ manifestations, with differences between the two entities primarily based on the 
causes and duration of disease.  The trial design issues pertaining to SAR and PAR trials are also similar.  Thus, these two categories are treated collectivel y in this guidance as allergic rhinitis , 
with differences in recommendations for the design of SAR and PAR trials indicated.  Sponsors are encouraged to discuss details of trial design and specific issues relating to individual product s 
with division revie w staff before conducting clinical trials.  
 
This guidance does not contain discussion of the general issues of statistical analysis or clinical 
trial design.  Those topics are addressed in the ICH guidances for industry E9 Statistical 
Principles for Clinical Trials  and E10 Choice of Control Group and Related Issues in Clinical

for Drug Evaluation and Research at the Food and Drug Administration.   
 
2 For the purpose s of this guidance, the term  drug product  is inclusive of the small or large molecule active moiety 
or moieties in the formulation, along with the delivery device, if applicable .  Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

In general, FDA’s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities.  Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory r equirements are cited.  The use of 
the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.  
  
II. BACKGROUND  
 
Information about the pathophysiology and treatment of allergic rhinitis and its subtypes, SAR and PAR, has grown markedly in the past decade.  Patients with allergic rhinitis may have both 
nasal and non- nasal symptoms.  The main nasal symptoms of allergic rhinitis are nasal itching 
(i.e., nasal pruritus), sneezing, rhinorrhea, and nasal congestion.  Nasal pruritus and sneezing are 
induced by sensory nerve stimulation, whereas congestion results from vasodilation with 
resultant engorgement of cavernous sinusoids.  Rhinorrhea can be induced by increased vascular 
permeability as well as direct glandular secretion.  Important non- nasal symptoms commonly 
associated with allergic rhinitis include eye itching, tearing, eye redness, and itching of ears 
and/or palate.  
 A growing number of chemical mediators are believed to contribute to allergic rhinitis.  Desp ite 
different causes and temporal patterns of disease, the same groups of chemical mediators appear 
to be regulators of the responses in SAR and PAR .  It is for this reason that distinctions between 
SAR and PAR in terms of clinical trial design are made on ly in clinically relevant areas.  
  
III. OVERALL CONSIDERATIO NS — ADULT PROGRAM  
 
A. Number of Trials  
 
For approval of a new molecular entity in adult s, the Agency recommends at least two adequate 
and well -controlled phase 3 clinical trials to support either  the SAR or PAR indication.  
Alternatively, a sponsor can submit one SAR and one PAR trial in support of both indications, if 
both are adequate and well -controlled phase 3 trials and both demonstrate the safety and 
effectiveness of the drug for the indicat ions.  If a drug is approved for one of these two related 
indications, a single trial may support approval for the other indication.  For example, a single PAR trial may support approval for a PAR indication if the drug is already approved for SAR.

4 When final, this guidance will represent the FDA’s current thinking on this topic.   For the most recent version of a 
guidance, check the FDA guidance web page at https://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm .  Contains Nonbinding Recommendations  
 3 B. Dose 
 
The dose -response relationship for a n investigational product  should be  evaluated in these trials  
or in dedicated dose -ranging trial(s).  The goal of dose exploration is to identify the optimal dose 
and dosing frequency , balancing benefit with risk .  Ideally, dose exploration should be conducted 
in a real -world setting, because other exposure models, such as park or inhalation chamber trials , 
may not be predictive of real -world clinical responses.  Likewise, dose selection should be based 
on clinically meaningful endpoints, because pharmacodynamic (PD) markers may not be 
predictive.  
 
C. Safety Monitoring 
 Clinical efficacy trials must also address safety concerns, such as monitoring for adverse events, performing routine laboratory tests (i.e., blood chem istry, liver function tests, complete blood 
count with differential), urinalyses, and electrocardiograms, as appropriate  (21 CFR 
312.23(a)(6)) .  For SAR and PAR phase 3 trials, routine laboratory tests are recommended in 
trial patients at least at the initial screening and at the last visit.  
 For products with systemic bioavailability, the Agency recommends that the safety program include a thorough cardiac safety evaluation.  In general, a risk of clinically significant QT prolongation would render the ris k-benefit unfavorable for an allergic rhinitis product intended 
for symptomatic benefit.  Clinical electrocardiographic evaluation should be performed early in clinical development.  Clinical trials to assess the potential of a product to delay cardiac repolarization are described in detail in the ICH guidance for i ndustry E14 Clinical Evaluation of 
QT/QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential for Non- Antiarrhythmic Drugs .  
Sponsors are encouraged to contact the review division regarding appropr iate cardiac safety 
monitoring for their respective development programs.  For some classes of product s, sponsors may wish to provide some assessment of the degree of 
sedation compared to the placebo in the safety database.  Adequate assessments of sedatio n are 
primarily based on individual patient adverse event reports of sedation and/or drowsiness (or similar terminology, as defined by the sponsor’s adverse event dictionary).  The need for 
additional evaluation, such as driving simulation trials , depends on the characteristics and 
intended use of the individual product.  
 Long -term safety data should include at least 300 patients evaluated for 6 months and 100 
patients evaluated for 1 year, with the overall patient database including at least 1 ,500 patients .  
We recommend that a sufficient number of patients receive the highest dose proposed for marketing .  (See the ICH guidance for industry  E1A The Extent of Population Exposure to Assess 
Clinical Safety :  For Drugs Intended For Long- Term Treatment of Non- Life-Threatening 
Conditions .)  Measurements of efficacy endpoints are recommended in long- term safety trials as 
secondary assessments.   
 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations  
 4 D. Corticosteroid -Specific Issues  
 
Important safety issues for intranasal corticosteroids that ordinarily should be addre ssed in the 
adult clinical program include: 
 
• Assessment of adrenal function using either 24 -hour urinary -free cortisol levels or 24-
hour plasma cortisol area under the curve levels measured pretreatment and after at least 6 weeks of treatment with the inve stigational product .  A placebo and an active control 
are recommended in these trials . 
 
• Evaluation for possible cataract formation in long- term trials by slit lamp examination, 
pre- and post -treatment .  
 
• Evaluation for glaucoma in long -term trials , using i ntra-ocular pressures monitored pre - 
and post -treatment .  
 
E. Issues Specific to Topical Products   
 Given the risk for local toxicity, safety monitoring should include baseline and serial nasal  
examinations.  P respecified grading criteria to assess for the  presence of  nasal irritation (e.g., 
mucosal edema, erythema, epistaxis), ulceration, and septal perforation can be useful for documenting any changes over the course of the treatment period.  
 The whole product, including the dedicated delivery system, is considered a drug -device 
combination product as defined in 21 CFR 3.2(e).  Changes in the formulation, excipients, 
formulation flow path within the device, or device components (e.g., dimensions, materials of 
construction, coatings) can alter the delivery characteristics and affect  the clinical performance 
and user interface of the product.  Therefore, we  recommend that all key  trials  in the 
development program, including dose -ranging trials  and confirmatory efficacy and safety trials , 
be conducted with the  to-be-marketed product .  Furthermore, data should be provided on the 
performance and reliability of the new delivery system over the period of intended use.  
 In vitro and clinical bridging data may be needed  to support any changes in the formulation and 
delivery system.  Depending on the nature and extent of the changes, the altered product may be viewed as a new product, necessitating a separate development program with efficacy and safety trials.  We recommend that sponsors discuss any planned changes to  a topical product with the 
review division.   Bridging studies of nasal products for local action, particularly products that are in a suspension state, can be a substantial undertaking.  Principles that may apply to such a bridging program are outlined i n the draft guidance for i ndustry  Bioavailability and Bioequivalence Studies for Nasal 
Aerosols and Nasal Sprays for Local Action.

guidance, check the FDA guidance web page at https://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryIn formation/Guidances/default.htm .  Contains Nonbinding Recommendations  
 5 IV. OVERALL CONSIDERATIO NS — PEDIATRIC PROGR AM 
 
The pediatric age ranges proposed for a product, particularly for young patients, should be 
justified by the sponsor based on the prevalence of disease and the need for treatment in that age group.  Products indicated for the treatment of SAR generally should be evaluated in children down to the age of 2 years, while products indicated for the treatment of PAR should be  
evaluated in children down to the age of 6 months.  For t opical products, the appropriateness of 
the delivery system for the proposed age range  is an additional consideration.  Sponsors are 
encouraged to discuss  the specifics of pediatric programs with the division on a case -by-case 
basis  and to begin discussions about their pediatric formulation and clinical development plans  
as early as feasible because sponsors are required to submit pediatric study plans unde r the 
Pediatric Research Equity Act no later than 60 days after an end- of-phase 2 meeting .  We 
recommend sponsors refer to the Pediatric Research Equity Act as amended by the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act.
6 
 
A. Pediatric Dose Selection  
 
For product s already approved and/or adequately studied in adults but not yet studied in children, 
an appropriate pediatric dose should be determined.  In addition, adequate short - and long -term 
safety information for the proposed pediatric age group should be provided.  For oral formulations where a reasonable pharmacokinetic  (PK)/ PD link for efficacy has been 
established, PK data from children can be used to determine comparable exposure to adult patients, and therefore the appropriate pediatric dos e.   
 For intranasal formulations, efficacy trials in pediatric patients are recommended, because plasma drug levels are not consistently detectable or reliable as measures of local bioavailability and topical efficacy.  
 
B. Safety Data 
 
Typically, 3 months  of additional specific pediatric safety data for intranasal products and 
1 month of additional specific pediatric safety data for oral products are recommended.  We suggest that the se data be collected in controlled trials.  However, the duration and number of 
pediatric patients exposed to the investigational product  for safety monitoring should be 
determined on an individual basis for each product , based on anticipated side effects, pediatric 
PK data, and safety concerns.  
 
C. Corticosteroid -Specific Issues  
 
For intranasal corticosteroids, we recommend a 6 -week hypothalamic -pituitary -adrenal ( HPA)  
axis trial, with a placebo and an active control .  Such a trial is intended to evaluate influences of 
                                                 
6 See section 505B(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended by section 506 of the Food and 
Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, and the draft guidance for industry Pediatric Study Plans:  Conte nt 
of and Process for Submitting Initial Pediatric Study Plans and Amended Initial Pediatric Study Plans .  When final, 
this guidance will represent the FDA’s current thinking on this topic.   For the most recent version of a guidance, 
check the FDA guidance web page at https://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm .  Contains Nonbinding Recommendations  
 6 the product on the HPA axis that are not limited to HPA axis  suppression alone.  Because of 
ethical concerns about the use of oral prednisone as an active control in adrenal response trials in 
children, alternative approaches may be more appropriate.  Such approaches can include use of an approved intranasal cortic osteroid that is sufficient to cause an HPA axis effect.  
 Based on information indicating that intranasal corticosteroids have the potential to decrease growth velocity in children, a growth trial is recommended for prepubertal children.  If the trials 
are to be conducted postapproval, it may be useful for a sponsor to include a knemometry trial in 
the new drug application to provide PD growth data for consideration during the initial review.  Recommendations regarding the design and conduct of a growth tri al are outlined in the 
guidance for i ndustry  Orally Inhaled and Intranasal Corticosteroids:  Evaluation of the Effects 
on Growth in Children.  Sponsors are encouraged to discuss the details of their pediatric growth 
trial design s with the review division. 
  
V. PROTOCOL ISSUES AND ELEMENTS  
 
A. Trial Design  
 
The following are general recommendations on trial design for phase 3 allergic rhinitis (SAR and PAR) trials .  
 
• Double -blind, placebo -controlled, and parallel group trials are recommended, preferably 
with a placebo run -in period.  The placebo run- in period can be used to assess for a 
minimum level of compliance and symptom severity before  the double -blind treatment 
period. 
 
• The suggested duration of the double -blind treatment period is at least 2 weeks for  SAR 
trials and 4 weeks for PAR trials.  
 
• For SAR trials, the Agency recommends that the protocol include plans for measuring 
pollen counts at the different trial centers.  The final report can then document the 
exposure of patients to the relevant allergen s during the trial period.  It may also be  
helpful to collect data on the number of rainy days during the trial and the extent of 
patient exposure to outdoor air.  
 
• For SAR trials, we encourage randomization of patients within each center into the 
double -blind portion over a short time period, because  this generally reduces variability 
in allergen exposure.  The time period for randomization should be the shortest period 
that is feasible, given the size of the trial and variability in weather.  
 
• Many patients  with PAR may have concomitant SAR.  Therefore, it is helpful if PAR 
efficacy trials are conducted during a time when relevant seasonal allergens are less abundant and therefore less likely to influence trial results .  
 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations  
 7 B. Inclusion Criteria  
 
The following  are general recommendations on the inclusion criteria  for phase 3 allergic rhinitis 
trials . 
 
• For SAR trials in older children, adolescents, and adults, it is recommended that patients 
have a history of SAR for a minimum of 2 years before trial entry.  The  Agency 
recommends documentation of sensitivity by positive skin testing (by prick or 
intradermal methods) or by adequately validated in vitro tests for specific Immunoglobulin E ( IgE) (e.g., radioallergosorbent test ( RAST ), paper 
radioimmunosorbent test  (PRIST )) to the relevant seasonal allergen for the geographic 
area of the trial within 12 months before  enrollment.  In general  a positive skin test is 
defined as a wheal  greater than or equal to  3 millimeters ( mm)  larger than the diluent 
control with eryth ema for prick testing or greater than or equal to  7 mm larger than the 
diluent control with erythema for intradermal testing.  Positive in vitro tests are determined by the standards of the individual reference laboratory.  Positive skin tests or in vitro tests for specific IgE should correlate to the allergy history before the results are accepted as meeting inclusion criteria.  
 
• For PAR trials, allergy to perennial allergens (e.g., dust mites, cockroaches, cats, dogs, 
molds) can be demonstrated in trial pa tients by prick or intradermal skin testing (using 
the criteria for positivity above) or by adequately validated in vitro tests for specific IgE 
(e.g., RAST, PRIST).  We suggest that these tests be performed during the 12 months before enrollment.  The pat ient should have a relevant allergy history to the tested 
allergen.  
 
• The Agency recommends that patients not start immunotherapy or have a change in dose 
for approximately 1 month preceding enrollment in the trial.  Ideally, p atients  should 
maintain the sa me dose throughout the trial. 
 
• Patients should be experiencing symptoms meeting or exceeding an appropriate minimum level at the time of trial enrollment.  This can be ensured by assessing the 
severity of the symptoms for the primary endpoint and requiring  at least moderate 
severity for all or the majority of individual symptoms, as defined by the trial’ s symptom 
scoring scale.  
 
C. Exclusion Criteria  
 
The following are general recommend ations on the  exclusion criteria  for phase 3 allergic rhinitis 
trials:  
• Asthma, with the exception of mild intermittent asthma,
7 to lessen confounding by 
asthma medications, some of which may modify allergic rhinitis . 
                                                 
7 See the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Asthma Education and Prevention Pro gram “Expert 
Panel Report 3:  Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma” at https ://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health -
pro/guidelines/current/asthma -guidelines/index.htm .  Contains Nonbinding Recommendations  
 8  
• Chronic or intermittent use of inhaled, oral, intramuscular, intravenous, and/or potent 
topical corticosteroids . 
 
• Use of leukotriene modifiers . 
 
• Use of long -acting antihistamines . 
 
• Prohibited medications or inadequate washout periods (for certain drug classes).  The 
following washout periods are generally sufficient:  
 ‒ Intranasal or systemic corticosteroids (1 mon th) 
‒ Leukotriene modifiers  (1 month)  
‒ Intranasal cromolyn (2 weeks)  
‒ Intranasal or systemic decongestants (3 days)  
‒ Cetirizine, fexofenadine, loratadine, desloratadine, hydroxyzine (5 to 10 days)  
‒ Intranasal antihistamines (3 days)  
‒ Other systemic antihistamines  (3 days)  
 
• Documented evidence of acute or significant chronic sinusitis, as determined by the 
individual investigator . 
 
• Chronic use of concomitant medications (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants) that would affect assessment of the effectiveness of the inves tigational product . 
 
• A history of hypersensitivity to the product  or its excipients . 
 
• Presence of rhinitis secondary to other causes . 
 
• Presence of ocular herpes simplex or cataracts (for intranasal corticosteroid trials), or a history of glaucoma (for intr anasal corticosteroid or anticholinergic trials) . 
 
• Planned travel outside the trial area for a substantial portion of the trial period. 
 
D. Blinding  
 
Because allergic rhinitis trials are based on subjective endpoints, blinding is a critical consideration.  The process of ensuring blinding to the investigational product  should be 
described in the protocol.  If double -blinding is not possible, a rationale should be provided, 
along with a discussion of the means for reducing or eliminating bias.  For topical n asal 
formulations , a description of the differences in appearance between active and placebo 
treatments in the protocol (e.g., differences in the device or in the odor or characteristic of the formulation) can  help determine the adequacy of the trial blind. 
 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations  
 9 E. Formulations and Dosage Regimens  
 
Sponsors are encouraged to provide information in the protocol on the specific formulations used 
for both the to -be marketed product  and the placebo, along with a description of the dosing 
regimen.  We recommend that  dose -ranging and confirmatory trials  use the to -be-marketed 
product .  If not, the sponsor should address how the safety and effectiveness of the studied 
formulation will be bridged to the to- be-marketed formulation.  If bridging  of one formulation to 
another is proposed, information about the formulation composition and trial lots should be 
included in the final reports for the respective products.  
 
F. Evaluation  
 
The following are general recommendations on trial assessments in phase 3 allergic rhinitis trials.  
 
1. Assessment of Patient Compliance  
 
The protocol or final report should provide information about how compliance with the investigational product  use will be determined and documented throughout the trial and how 
noncompliance will be dealt with.  
 
2. Assessment of Rescue Medication Use 
 
If rescue medications are allowed during the trial, the protocol should document how rescue medication use will be analyzed in the different treatment groups.  We recommend inclusion of a section in the clinical tr ial report that presents rescue medication use in the different treatment 
groups.  
 
3. Rating System  
 
The preferred measures of efficacy in allergic rhinitis trials are patient self -rated instantaneous 
and reflective total nasal symptom scores.  These summe d scores generally include the following 
four nasal symptoms:  rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, nasal itching, and sneezing rated on a 0 to 3 scale of severity.  Addition or deletion of symptoms to or from the total score can be appropriate, based on the mech anism of action.  Such changes should be discussed with the review division.  
Patient -rated scores are preferred as the primary measure of effectiveness.  
 A common allergic rhinitis rating system that has been used in clinical trials is the following 0  to 
3 scale:  
 
• 0 = absent symptoms (no sign/symptom evident)  
 
• 1 = mild symptoms (sign/symptom present, but minimal awareness; easily tolerated)  
 
• 2 = moderate symptoms (definite awareness of sign/symptom that is bothersome but 
tolerable)  Contains Nonbinding Recommendations  
 10  
• 3 = severe symptoms (si gn/symptom that is hard to tolerate; causes interference with 
activities of daily living and/or sleeping)  
 
Regardless of the scoring system chosen, a detailed description of the symptom rating scale should be provided to patients.  This should include inst ructions on proper completion of the 
symptom diary and definitions of the different categories in the scale.
8 
 
4. Recording Scores  
 
The Agency recommends that patients be instructed to record their symptom scores in diaries  at 
least as often as the daily d osing interval.  Collection of both reflective  symptom scores (i.e., an 
evaluation of symptom severity after a predefined time period such as 12 hours) and instantaneous  symptom scores (i.e., an evaluation of symptom severity immediately before the 
next dose) is recommended.  Reflective symptom scores assess the overall degree of effectiveness over a prespecified time interval, whereas instantaneous scores assess effectiveness at the end -of-dosing interval and can be used to assess onset of action.  
 
5. Adverse Event Recording  
 
We recommend that adverse events be recorded in a daily patient diary record, in addition to being elicited by trial staff at clinic visits.  
  
VI. DATA ANALYSIS ISSUES  
 
A. Symptom S cores  
 
Symptom scores should be collected at baseline and daily over the course of the trial.  Collection 
of baseline symptom scores over several days immediately preceding patient randomization will 
permit the evaluation of baseline comparability of the various treatment arms, as well as the determination of  treatment effects over time.  
 An appropriate primary efficacy endpoint is the change from baseline in the reflective total nasal 
symptom score (TNSS) averaged over  the entire double -blind treatment period (2 weeks for 
SAR and 4 weeks for PAR).  Depending on the drug class being evaluated, the TNSS is defined as a total score composed of at least three of the following four nasal symptoms:  rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, nasal itching, and sneezing.  Inclusion of nasal congestion in the TNSS may be appropria te for an intranasal corticosteroid or a decongestant, but may not be appropriate for an 
antihistamine, anticholinergic, or cromolyn -like agent.  
 An appropriate key secondary endpoint is the change from baseline in the instantaneous TNSS across  the double -blind treatment period to assess the appropriateness of the dosing interval.  The 
                                                 
8 See the guidance for industry Patient- Reported Outcome Measures:  Use in Medical Product Development to 
Support Labeling Claims .  Contains Nonbinding Recommendations  
 11 development program should demonstrate  a significant difference between the product and 
placebo at the end of the dosing interval  averaged across the double -blind treatment p eriod . 
 
When designing allergic rhinitis protocols, sponsors are encouraged to numerically define a clinically meaningful change in the primary efficacy endpoint , and provide the rationale for this 
selection .  The statistical section of the protocol should include a power  calculation using this 
value a nd shoul d prospectively discuss how missing data will be handled in the analysis plan.  In 
particular, the protocol should define the primary estimand ( i.e., the primary measure of 
treatment effect to be estim ated in the clinical trial ) and justify that the estimand can be estimated 
with minimal and plausible assumptions.  Furthermore, we recommend continued collection of efficacy and safety data after treatment discontinuation and rescue medication use to faci litate 
evaluation of treatment policy estimands . 
 In addition to evaluating the effectiveness of the product over the entire double -blind period, 
additional data presentations can be helpful in evaluating effectiveness.  These include:  
 
• Presenting the morn ing and evening  symptom scores separately for both the reflective 
and instantaneous symptom assessments . 
 
• Presenting the efficacy data for the first few days of the trial separately for both the 
reflective and instantaneous symptom assessments.  This data presentation also can 
separate the morning  and evening  scores.  This allows some assessment of the onset of 
action.  
 
• Presenting the efficacy data for each week individually for both the reflective and 
instantaneous symptom assessments.  This allows determ ination of both the onset of 
action and the durability of the response over the course of the clinical trial. 
 • Presenting  the efficacy data for the individual component symptom scores that comprise 
the total symptom complex . 
 
Other patient -rated and physician -rated measures can be included as secondary efficacy 
endpoints.  For example, assessment of ocular symptoms associated with allergic rhinitis may be applicable for certain products.  Patient -rated, reflective, and instantaneous total ocular symptom 
scores, similar to the symptom scoring system used for nasal symptoms, can  be used to support 
inclusion of relevant information in labeling.  Information from disease -specific quality -of-life 
measures also can be considered for inclusion in labeling.  We anti cipate r eplicate data from at 
least two trials to support inclusion of such measures in labeling.  
 
B. Onset of Action  
 
The definition of the onset of action of an allergic rhinitis product is the point at which patients might reasonably expect to see a meaningful decrease in their allergic rhinitis symptoms.  For the purposes of allergic rhinitis, it is the first time point after initiation of treatment when the product demonstrates a greater change from baseline i n the primary efficacy endpoint  compared to  the Contains Nonbinding Recommendations  
 12 placebo treatment  that proves durable from this point until the end of the proposed dosing 
interval.  
 
Because onset of action information may be included in labeling, at least two trials are recommended to support a particular onset of action claim.  It is useful to assess onset of action 
during development, regardless of any proposed claims.  The two trials do not have to be identical in design, nor do they have to evaluate both SAR and PAR.  Because onset of action is largely a PD  issue, a number of different trial designs  can be used.  Following are three types that 
have been used:  
 
1. Standard phase 3 allergic rhinitis efficacy trials in which symptom scoring data are collected frequently for the first few days  
 
2. A single -dose, parallel group, placebo- controlled trial of patients in a park setting in 
which patients are exposed to relevant outdoor seasonal allergens and, following dosing, have nasal symptoms evaluated on an hourly basis  
 
3. An inhalation chamber trial (also known as environmental exposure unit ( EEU) ) in which 
previously asymptomatic patients are exposed to a relevant allergen (generally a seasonal allergen, such as ragweed) in a controlled indoor setting and, following dosing, have their nasal symptoms evaluated on an hourly basis  
 Onset of a ction data can come from any of these three designs .  However, if EEU and/or park 
trials are used to support an onset of action claim shorter than the onset of action seen in the phase 3 trials, the Agency recommends that the results be replicated to be co nsidered 
independently informative.  This is due to the shorter duration of these trials and the restricted setting and manner in which they are conducted.  In any case, information about onset of action derived from the phase 3 trials used to support appr oval also can  be included in the proposed 
package insert along with any data from park or chamber trials , to reflect the real world setting of 
the treatment trials.  
  
VII. FIXED -DOSE COMBINATION PRODUCTS  
 
In addition to the general principles outlined in 21 CFR 300.50 regarding the development of fixed -dose combination products, other considerations for allergic rhinitis combination products 
include the following:  
 
• The contribution of each monotherapy component should be supported by replicate, 
appropriatel y designed and conducted trials where the combination product is compared 
to each component.  The treatment difference between each component and the 
combination product should be clinically meaningful and statistically significant.  
• The efficacy and safet y of the dose and dosing regimen for each individual component 
should be established ( i.e., the monotherapy components should be tested at an effective 
dose and dosing regimen ).   Contains Nonbinding Recommendations  
 13  
• For locally  acting topical products, pharmaceutical differences between the  combination 
product a nd each component may  obscure the comparison of the combination product to 
each of its components  used in a clinical trial.  As a result, commercially available 
comparators may not be appropriate for the purposes of factorial comparis on.  S ponsors 
will likely  need to develop monotherapy comparator products specifically for the 
purposes of the combination product development program . 
 
• Patients who have  already  failed one component of the combination product should be 
excluded , unless there is scientific justification to an exception.   
 
Given the complexity of development programs for fixed- dose, locally acting combination 
products, sponsors are encouraged to discuss the details of the monotherapy components and trial 
design s with the re view division  early in the development program s.

This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) on 
this topic.  It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public.   You

I. INTRODUCTION  
 
This guidance is one in a series of guidance s that provide recommendations regarding eligibility 
criteria  for clinical trials of  drugs or biological products2 regulated by  CDER and CBER  for the 
treatment of cancer .3 Specifically, this guid ance includes recommendations regarding  the 
inclusion of patients with organ dysfunction  or with prior or concurrent malignancies . This 
guidance is intended to assist stakeholders , including  sponsors and institutional review boards , 
responsible for  the developm ent and oversight of clinical trials .  
 
A clinical trial’s eligibility criteria ( for inclusion and exclusion) are essential components of the 
trial, defining the characteristics of the study population. Because there is variability in 
investigational drugs  and trial objectives, eligibility criteria should be developed taking into 
consideration the mechanism of action of the drug, the targeted disease or patient population, the 
anticipated safety of the investigational drug, the availability of adequate safe ty data, and the 
ability to recruit trial participants from the patient population to meet the objectives of the 
clinical trial. However, some eligibility  criteria have become commonly accepted over ti me or 
used as  a template across trials without clear sc ientific or clinical rationale. Unnecessarily 
restrictive eligibility  criteria may slow patient accrual , limit  patient s’ access to clinical trials , and 
                                                 
1 This guidance has  been prepared by the Oncology Center of Excellence, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research 
(CDER), and Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) at the Food and Drug Administration.   
2 For the purposes  of this  guidance, references  to drugs  and drug and biological products include drugs approved 
under section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic  Act (21 U.S.C. 355) and biological products licensed 
under section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262) . 
3 Topics of the other three guidances are related to eligibility criteria for patients with human immunodeficiency 
virus, hepatitis B virus, or hepatitis C virus infections; for pat ients with brain metastases;  and regarding minimum 
age considerations for inclusion of pedi atric patients.

 2 lead to trial results that do not  fully  represent treatment effects in the patient population that will 
ultimately use the drug.4,5 
 
Broadening cancer  trial eligibility criteria can maximize the generalizability of trial results and 
the ability to understand the therapy’s benefit -risk profile a cross the patient population likely to 
use the drug in clinical practice and should be considered to avoid  jeopardizing patient safety.  
 
Trial design and methodological approaches are important considerations when enrolling a 
broader population and are ad dressed elsewhere6,7 and are not addressed in this guidance because 
the considerations are not specific to enrolling patients with organ dysfunction or prior or 
concurrent malignancies. 
 
In general, FDA’s guidance documents do not establish legally enforce able responsibilities. 
Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only 
as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of 
the word should  in Agency guidances means t hat something is suggested or recommended, but 
not required.  
 
 
II. BACKGROUND  
 
Patients with organ dysfunction are often excluded from clinical trials, regardless of knowledge 
of the metabolic pathways and excretory routes of the  investigational drug . The life-span of the 
general population is increasing  and thus includes increasing numbers of patients with co-morbid 
renal disease, cardiac disease, and hepatic dysfunction. Additionally, as life-span of the general 
population increas es, a greater number of  patients are anticipated to have  prior or concurrent 
malig nancies . By excluding individuals from cancer clinical trials  who have  major organ 
dysfunction  or previous or concurrent cancers , trial recruitment may favor younger patients , 
which may not be  fully  representative of the population for whom the drug will be indicated . 
Designing cancer clinical trials that include patients with organ dysfunction and prior or 
concurrent malignancies an d including this information in the labeling promotes the safe and 
effective use of these products across a broad er patient population likely to use the drug in 
clinical practice .

 3 III. RECOMMENDATIONS      
 
Thoughtful  consideration should be given to the potential inclusion of patients with organ 
dysfunction  or prior or concurrent malignancies in cancer clinical trials.  The following 
recommendations for eligibility criteria for  patients with  organ dysfunction in cancer  clinical 
trials focus on renal function, cardiac function, and hepatic function. This guidance also includes 
recommendations for eligibility criteria for patients with cancer who have prior or concurrent  
malignancies.   
 
A. Patients with organ dysfunction  
 
When pharmacokinetics (PK) and major routes of elimination in humans are not well 
understood, it is reasonable to enroll only patients with relatively preserved  organ function 
(primarily renal and hepatic) in  cancer clinical trials. As data on toxicity , including nonclinical 
and clinical toxicity , PK, and /or pharmacodynamics (PD) become available during drug 
development, protocols should be revised to include patients with compromised organ function 
where safe parameters  regarding dosage adjustments  have been  determined.8 
 
1. Renal function recommendations  
 
• Eligibility criteria should be based on a contemporary, widely accepted, and 
clinically applicable equation that estimates glomerular filtration rate or a 
measure of glomerular filtration rate  rather than an absolute serum creatinine 
concentration.  The equ ation use d for a particular patient population  should 
remain consistent throughout  the investigational drug development process.  
 
• Sponsors should provide adequate justification for the inclusion/exclusion of 
patients with various degrees of renal impairme nt based on the stage of 
product development, safety profile of the product , understanding of the effect 
of renal impairment on the elimination of the drug , and the safety of study 
procedures in patients with renal impairment.  
 
• Patients with renal impairment should be included in trials of investigational 
drugs when the available nonclinical and clinical data indicate that inclusion 
of patients with renal impairment would not place patients at unreasonable 
risk and/or adequate st eps can be taken to mitigate potential risks. When there 
is an expectation that the systemic exposure  will increase in patients  with 
renal dysfunction, inclusion of such patients  may be facilitated by prospective 
dose adjustment to produce similar systemic  exposures to those seen in 
patients with relatively preserved kidney function.9

FDAsummary.pdf?1534970149  (accessed June 23 , 2020). Contains Nonbinding Recommendations  
 
 4 • Sponsors should address the need for and timing of studies to evaluate the 
effect of dialysis on drug clearance and the need for dosage adjustment for 
patients on dialysis.  
 
If there is adequate representation of patients with varying degrees of renal impairment, as well 
as data sufficient to adequately describe the impact of renal impairment on PK of the drug, 
population pharmacokinetic (popPK) analyses of data from phase 2 or  phase 3 clinical trials may 
be sufficient to characterize the impact of renal function.  
 
2. Cardiac function recommendations  
 
• Inclusion of patients with cardiovascular dysfunction may be possible when 
available nonclinical and clinical data, including PK and  PD data, indicate that 
inclusion of these patients does not expose them to  unreasonable risk . 
 
• Patients with significant clinical cardiac abnormalities (e.g., clinical heart 
failure, unstable angina) should be  excluded, especially in early -phase studies.  
 
• Inclusion criteria should require  investigator assessment of a potential 
participant’s risk for heart failure with a validated clinical classification 
system (e.g., the New York Heart Association Functional Classification).  
 
• Ejection fraction (E F) measurement : 
 
- EF measured by either echocardiography or multigated acquisition 
scan is acceptable for deter mining cardiac EF  for eligibility  criteria  
purposes .  
 
• QTc Prolongation :10 
 
- Sponsors should assess the effects of a drug on QTc during early 
clinical development.    
 
- Sponsors should determine whether a maximum QTc interval is 
necessary as a clinical trial eligibility criteri on based on whether there 
is a specific known risk of QTc prolongation, either through non -
clinical (e.g., hERG) or clinical trial data.

Potential for Non -Antiarrhythmic Drugs  (October 20 05) and the ICH guidance for industry E14 Clinical Evaluation 
of QT/QTc  Inter val Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential for Non -Antiarrhythmic Drugs – Questions and 
Answers (R3)  (June 2017) for additional information regarding QTc prolongation.   
 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations  
 
 5 3. Hepatic function recommendations  
 
Unlike other organ systems , liver biochemical testing does not provide sufficient  evidence of 
adequate liver drug metabolic function. While e stimates of hepatic function that incorporate 
clinical variables as well as functional and laboratory values, such as the Child -Pugh and Model  
for End -Stage Liver Disease scoring systems ,11,12 are adopted as markers of  hepatic metabolism  
in dedicated PK studies , hepatic metabolism may also be influenced by cancer and inflammation, 
even in the setting of normal scoring . To gauge  hepatic drug transf ormation capacity, pre -
existing liver disease, as well as epidemiological, genetic, environmental, and historical variables 
(e.g., chronic alcohol use and a past history of adverse drug reactions ) should be ascertained. 
Impaired hepatic blood flow, in part icular  when portal hypertension is ev ident, is critical to 
assessing how the liver metabolizes  drugs.  
 
• Inclusion of patients with severe hepatic impairment should be discussed with 
FDA.  
 
• Patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment13 (defined as the 
equivalent of National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (NCI CTC AE) grade 1 toxicity), as well as those with 
aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) elevations 
defined as grade 3 by the NCI CTCAE  (> 5 to 20 x ULN (upper limit of 
normal) ), may be asymptomatic and able to tolerate  doses equivalent to 
patients with normal hepatic function.  
 
• Inclusion of patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment may be 
appropriate when the available nonclinical and clinical data, including PK and 
PD data, indicate that inclusion of these patients  does not present  an 
unreasonable risk to patients . 
 
B. Patients with prior  or concurrent malignancy  
 
Patients with  prior  malignancies of the same or different tumor type and patients with concurrent  
malignanc ies of the same or different tumor type (referred to as  prior or conc urrent malignancies  
in this guidance)  whose natural history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with 
the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational drug should generally be eligible for 
enrollment in clinical trials . For example, in initial  dose finding or preliminary activity -estimating 
or proof -of-concept studies , patients with a history of prior  or concurrent  malignancies should not 
be excluded .

I. INTRODUCTION  
 
This guidance provides recommendations to applicants on endpoints for cancer clinical trials 
submitted to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to support effectiveness claims in new 
drug applications (NDAs), biologics license applications (BLAs), or supplemental applications.2  
It also provides background information and discusses general regulatory principles.  The 
endpoints discussed in this guidance are for drugs to treat patients with an existing cancer.3  This 
guidance does not address endpoints for drugs to prevent or decrease the incidence of cancer.  
 
This guidance is a revision of the final guidance of the same title that published in May 2007.

In general, FDA ’s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities.  
Instead , guidances describe the Agency’ s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only 
as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited.  The use of

 2 II. BACKGROUND  
 
Clinical trial endpoints serve different purposes. In conventional oncology drug development, 
early phase clinical trials evaluate safety and identify evidence of biological drug activity, such 
as tumor shrinkage.  Endpoints for later phase efficacy studies commonly evaluate whether a 
drug provides a clinical benefit such as prolongation of survival or an improvement in 
symptoms.  The following sections discuss the general regulatory requirements for efficacy and 
how they have influenced endpoint selection for the approval of cancer drugs.  Later sections 
describe these endpoints in more detail and discuss whether they might serve as measures of 
disease activity or clinical benefit in various clinical settings.  
 
A. Statutory and Regulator y Requirements for Effectiveness  
 
The requirement that new drugs show effectiveness is based on a 1962 amendment to the Federal 
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act  (FD&C Act) .  This law requires substantial evidence of 
effectiveness and specifies that this eviden ce must be derived from adequate and well -controlled 
clinical investigations.  Similarly, the Public Health Service Act requires biological products to 
be safe, pure, and potent.4  Clinical benefits that have supported drug approval have included 
important  clinical outcomes (e.g., increased survival, symptomatic improvement) but have also 
included effects on surrogate endpoints  known to predict clinical benefit  (e.g., blood pressure).  
 
The accelerated approval regulations (21 CFR part 314, subpart H and 21 CFR part 601, 
subpart E), promulgated in 1992, allow use of additional endpoints for approval of drugs or 
biological products that are intended to treat serious or life -threatening diseases and that 
generally  demonstrate an improvement over available ther apy or provide therapy where none 
exists.  In this setting, the FDA may grant approval based on an effect on a surrogate endpoint 
that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit.5  Such surrogate  endpoint s are less well -
established than  those surrogate  endpoint s for traditional approvals , such as blood pressure for 
cardiovascular disease.   FDA may also grant accelerated approval based on an effect on a 
clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality that is 
reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical 
benefit (i.e., an intermediate clinical endpoint).6  A drug is approved under the accelerated 
approval regulations on condition that the manufacturer conduct s clinical studies to verify and 
describe the actual clinical benefit.7  If the postmarketing studies fail to demonstrate clinical 
benefit or if the applicant does not demonstrate due diligence in conducting the required 
studies, among other reasons, FDA m ay withdraw approval of the drug  or indication.8  In the  
following discussion, the term traditional approval denotes the longstanding route of drug 
approval based on the demonstration of clinical benefit  or an effect on a surrogate endpoint 
                                                 
4 Potency has long been interpreted to include effectiveness (21 CFR 600.3(s)).  
5 Section 506(c)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act.  21 CFR 314.510 and 601.41 provide that the Agency may consider “. . . 
epidemiologic, therapeutic, pathophysiologic, or other evidence . . .” in determining whether an endpoint is  
reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit.  The  Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012 
provides that FDA may consider “. . . epidemiological, pathophysiological, therapeutic, pharmacologic, or other 
evidence developed using biomarkers, for example, or other scientific methods or tools.”   See guidance for industry 
Expedited Programs for Serious Conditions –  Drugs and Biologics .

 3 known to predic t clinical benefit.  That term is distinguished from accelerated approval , which 
is associated with use of a surrogate endpoint or intermediate clinical endpoint that is 
reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit  to support drug approval . 
 
The evidence needed to establish effectiveness is discussed in the guidance for industry 
Providing Clinical Evidence of Effectiveness for Human Drug and Biological Products and the 
guidance for industry FDA Approval of New Cancer Treatment Uses for Marketed Drug and 
Biological Products .  In many  cases, at least two adequate and well -controlled clinical 
investigations  are needed.   In certain cases, evidence from a single adequate and well -controlled 
clinical investigation , with confirmatory evidence,  can be sufficient (e.g., in cases in which a 
single multicenter study provides highly reliable and statistically strong evidence of an important 
clinical benefit).  FDA may consider data from one adequate and well -controlled clinical 
investigation and con firmatory evidence as substantial evidence, if FDA determines that such 
data and evidence are sufficient to establish effectiveness.9  For example, for drugs approved for 
treatment of patients with a specific stage of a particular malignancy, evidence from  one 
adequate and well -controlled clinical investigation  with confirmatory evidence  may be sufficient 
to support an efficacy supplement for treatment of a different stage of the same cancer.  
 
B. Endpoints Supporting Past Approvals in Oncology  
 
For traditional approval, applicant s show direct evidence of clinical benefit or improvement in a 
surrogate  endpoint  known to predict  clinical benefit.   In oncology, survival improvement is 
considered an appropriate measure of clinical benefit.  In addition, s ponsors have used other 
endpoints for cancer drug approval.  In the 1970s, the FDA usually approved cancer drugs 
based on objective response rate (ORR), determined by tumor assessments from radiological 
tests or physical examinations.  In the early 1980s, after discussion with the Oncologic Drugs 
Advisory Committee (ODAC), the FDA determined that cancer drug approval should be based 
on more direct evidence of clinical benefit, such as improvement in survival, improvement in a 
patient’s quality of life, impr oved physical functioning, or improved tumor -related symptoms. 
These benefits may not always be predicted by, or correlate with, ORR.  
 
Over time, larger improvements in tumor reduction and delay in tumor growth have been seen, 
and tumor measurement endpoints have been used to support both traditional and accelerated 
approval.  Improvement in disease -free survival (DFS) has supported drug approval in selected 
adjuvant settings, in which a large proportion of patients were expected to have cancer 
symptoms at the time of recurrence.  Durable complete response has supported traditional 
approval in leukemia, where complete response  (CR) is associated with less infection, bleeding, 
and blood product support.  A large improvement in progression- free survival (PFS) or high, 
substantiated durable ORR has been used to support traditional approval in select malignancies, 
but magnitude of effect, relief of tumor -related symptoms, and drug toxicity should also be  
considered when making the approval decision.10,11,12  For example, randomized trials for

 4 hormonal drugs for breast cancer and a single arm trial of a drug for ROS1 -positive metastatic 
non-small cell lung cancer have used ORR as an endpoint supporting traditiona l approval. 
Improvement in tumor -related symptoms in conjunction with an improved ORR and adequate 
response duration has supported traditional approval in several clinical settings.  
 
Surrogate endpoints for accelerated approval must be reasonably likely to predict clinical 
benefit (FD&C Act § 506(c)(1)(A);  21 CFR part 314, subpart H ; and 21 CFR part 601, subpart 
E).  While durable ORR has been used as a traditional approval endpoint in some 
circumstances, ORR has also been the most commonly used surrogate e ndpoint in support of 
accelerated approval.  Tumor response is widely accepted by oncologists in guiding cancer 
treatments.   Because ORR is directly attributable to drug effect, single- arm trials conducted in 
patients with refractory tumors where no availa ble therapy exists provide an accurate 
assessment of ORR.  Whether tumor measures such as ORR or PFS are used as an accelerated 
approval or traditional approval endpoint will depend on the disease context and the magnitude 
of the effect, among other factor s (see sections III.B.2 and 4).  
 
 
III. GENERAL ENDPOINT CONSIDERATIONS  
 
This section provides an overview of general issues in cancer drug development.  A discussion of 
commonly used cancer endpoints is followed by a discussion of pertinent issues in cance r 
clinical trial design using these endpoints (see the guidances referenced in footnote 3 regarding 
non-small cell lung cancer and high -risk early -stage breast cancer  for more detailed discussion 
for these diseases ).  The endpoints that are discussed in this section include overall survival, 
endpoints based on tumor assessments (e.g., DFS , event -free survival (EFS) , ORR,  CR, time to 
progression (TTP), and PFS ), endpoints involving  symptom assessment, blood or body fluid -
based  biomarkers, and emerging endpoints.  Tables 1 and 2 provide a comparison of endpoints in 
cancer drug approval.  Many issues relating to the proper analysis of efficacy endpoints are 
addressed in the ICH guidance for industry E9 Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials.  
Recommendations regarding the use of placebos and blinding in randomized controlled clinical 
trials are described in the draft guidance  for industry  Hematologic Malignancy and Oncologic 
Disease:  Considerations for Use of Placebos and Bli nding in Randomized Clinical Trials for 
Drug Product Development .13  Cancer patient and caregiver experiences provide unique insights 
that contribute to important patient preference information for identifying relevant clinical trial 
endpoints to ultimately  inform medical product development programs that best meet patient 
needs.  Recommendations on how stakeholders can collect and submit patient experience data14

 5 Table 1.  A Comparison of Important Cancer Approval Endpoints  
 
As noted in the table, several oncology endpoints can serve different purposes (i.e., clinical 
endpoint that represents clinical benefit for traditional approval, surrogate endpoint to support 
traditional approval, surrogate endpoint to support accelerated approval) based on the specific 
context of use.  The determination is based on the specific diseases and is highly dependent upon 
factors such as effect size, effect duration, depth of response (e.g., number of CRs ), available 
therapy, disease setting, location of disease, the clinical consequences of delaying or preventing 
disease progression or delaying administration of more toxic therapies, and the risk- benefit 
relationship.  See text for details.  See section V regarding recommendations for  obtaining FDA 
feedback on endpoints and protocol design.

 7 A. Overall Survival 
 
Overall survival is defined as the time from randomization until death from any cause and  is 
measured in the intent- to-treat population.  Survival is considered the most reliable cancer 
endpoint, and when studies can be conducted to adequately assess survi val, it is usually the 
preferred endpoint.  This endpoint is precise and easy to measure, documented by the date of    
death.  Bias is not a factor in endpoint measurement.  Survival improvement should be analyzed as a risk -benefit analysis to assess clinical benefit.  
 Overall survival should be evaluated in randomized controlled studies.  Data derived from externally controlled  trials are seldom reliable for time -to-event  endpoints, including overall 
survival.  Apparent differences in outcome between external  controls and current treatment 
groups can arise from differences other than drug treatment, including patient selection, improved imaging techniques, or improved supportive care.  Randomized studies minimize the effect of these known and unknown differences by providing a direct outcome comparison.  Demonstration of a statistically significant improvement in overall survival can be considered to be clinically significant if the toxicity profile is acceptable and  has often supported new drug 
approva l. 
 Difficulties in performing and analyzing survival studies include long follow -up periods in 
large trials and subsequent cancer therapy potentially confounding survival analysis.  
B. Endpoints Based on Tumor Assessments  
 This section discusses several endpoints that are based on tumor assessments.  In many cancer 
types, radiographic t umor assessment s direct ly measure components of the disease, and tumor 
measures commonly trigger treatment decisions in clinical prac tice.  Therefore, tumor measure-
based endpoints are considered more clinically relevant than other biomarkers.  Tumor measure-based endpoints may support either traditional (as a clinical endpoint that represents clinical benefit or a surrogate endpoint for traditional approval) or accelerated  approval and include DFS 
(and EFS), ORR, CR, TTP, and PFS.   Tumor assessment endpoint selection should include two judgments.  First, a determination of 
whether the endpoint may support either accelerated approval or traditional approval should be ascertained.  Second, the endpoint should be evaluated for the potential of bias or uncertainty. Drug applications using studies that rely on tumor assessment  endpoints as sole evidence of 
efficacy may need confirmatory evidence from a second trial.  Accuracy in measuring tumors can differ among tumor settings.  Tumor measurements used in ORR  determinations can be 
imprecise in locations where there is a lack of demarcated margins (e.g., pleural or peritoneal mesothelioma, pancreatic cancer, brain tumors).  When the primary study endpoint is based on tumor measurements (e.g., PFS or ORR), tumor assessments generally should be verified by central reviewers blinded to study treatments (see Appendix) to ascertain lack of assessment bias .  Additional details regarding data collection are 
listed in the guidance for industry Clinical Trial Endpoints for the Approval of Non- Small Cell Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 
 
 8 Lung Cancer Drugs and Biologics , Appendix A.16  Alternatively, a random sample- based 
blinded central review auditing approach could be used with a detailed auditing plan prespecified 
including a strategy to detect potential assessment bias.  If bias cannot be excluded based upon the audit, a blinded central review of all radiographic images will be necessary .
17  Sponsors 
should seek FDA input prior to conducting an audit based central review.  Centralized independent verification of tumor assessment endpoints (especially  for PFS or DFS) may not be 
necessary when randomized trials are blinded (unless the adverse event profile would substantially unblind the trial in practice) or effect sizes are robust in large randomized trials where sensitivity analysis supports lack of investigator bias. 
 
1. Disease -Free Survival (and Event- Free Survival)  
 Generally, DFS is defined as the time from randomization until disease recurrence or death from any cause.  The most frequent use of this endpoint is in the adjuvant setting after defi nitive 
surgery or radiotherapy.  DFS also can be an important endpoint when a large percentage of 
patients achieve CRs  with chemotherapy.  Although overall survival is a conventional endpoint 
for most adjuvant settings, DFS can be an important endpoint in situations where survival may be prolonged, making an overall survival endpoint impractical.  An endpoint that is similar to DFS but is differentiated from it in that randomization takes place before definitive surgery or radiotherapy in the adjuvant setting is EFS.  For the purpose of this guidance, EFS is defined
 as 
time from randomization to any of the following events: progression of disease that precludes 
surgery, local or distant recurrence, or death due to any cause.   DFS has been the primary basis of 
approval for adjuvant breast cancer hormonal therapy, adjuvant colon cancer, and adjuvant 
cytotoxic breast cancer therapy, whereas EFS is an appropriate endpoint for the evaluation of neoadjuvant breast cancer therapy given prior to definitive surgery.  Compared with standard cytotoxic therapies, hormonal therapies carry minim al side effects and thus a favorable risk -
benefit relationship.  Treatment effect measured by DFS or EFS can be a surrogate endpoint to support accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint to support traditional approval, or it can represent direct clinical benefit based on the specific disease, context of use, magnitude of the effect, the disease setting, available therapy, and the risk -benefit relations hip.  In December 
2003, the ODAC consensus was DFS prolongation represented clinical benefit if the magnitude of this benefit outweighed the toxicity of the adjuvant treatment.  In May 2004, the ODAC recommended that DFS be considered a clinical endpoint for colon cancer drugs in the surgical adjuvant setting.
18  DFS has been used for traditional approval for diseases such as breast cancer, 
colorectal cancer, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, melanoma, and renal cell carcinoma.  
 
Important considerations in evaluating DFS  or EFS  as a potential endpoint include the estimated 
size of the treatment effect and proven benefits of standard therapies.   The protocol should 
                                                 
16 Appendices A -D in the guidance for industry Clinical Trial Endpoints for the Approval of Non- Smal l Cell Lung 
Cancer Drugs and Biologics , regarding tumor measurement data collection and PFS analysis also apply more 
broadly to oncology endpoints and should be used in conjunction with this guidance, as needed.

 9 carefully delineate both the definition of DFS or EFS  and the schedule for follow-up assessment s 
and visits.  Unscheduled assessments can occur for many reasons and differences between study 
arms in the frequency, timing, or reason for unscheduled assessments can introduce bias.  Bias can be minimized by blinding patients and investigators to the tr eatment assignments, as 
appropriate.   Application of the definition of DFS or EFS in a study can be complicated, particularly when deaths are noted without prior tumor progression documentation.  These events can be scored either as disease recurrences or  as censored events.   Although all methods for statistical analysis 
of deaths have some limitations, considering deaths from all causes as recurrences can minimize bias.  DFS  or EFS  can be overestimated using this definition, especially in patients 
who die after a long period without observation.  Bias can be introduced if the frequency of long- term follow -up visits is dissimilar between the study arms or if dropouts are not random 
because of toxicity.   Some analyses count cancer -related deaths as DFS  or EF S events and 
censor noncancer deaths.  This method can introduce bias in the attribution of the cause of death.  Furthermore, any method that censors observations on patients, whether at death or at the last visit, assumes that the patients with censored o bservations have the same risk of 
recurrence as patients with noncensored observations who have not yet experienced the event.  
2. Objective Response Rate  
 ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with tumor size reduction of a predefined amount and for a minimum time period.  Response duration usually is measured from the time of initial response until documented tumor progression.  Generally, the FDA has defined ORR as the sum of partial responses plus CRs .  When defined in this manner, ORR is a direc t measure of a 
drug antitumor activity, which can be evaluated in a single-arm study.  Stable disease should not be a component of ORR.  Stable disease can reflect the natural history of disease, whereas  
tumor reduction is a direct therapeutic effect.  Also, stable disease can be more accurately assessed by TTP or PFS analysis (see section III.B.4).   If available, standardized criteria should 
be used to ascertain response.  A variety of response criteria have been considered appropriate (e.g., revised RECIST guideline (version 1.1))
19  The response criteria should be predefined in 
the protocol before the start of the study.  The significance of ORR is assessed by its magnitude and duration, and the percentage of CRs .  Treatment effect measured by ORR can be a 
surrogate endpoint to support accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint to support traditional approval, or it can represent direct clinical benefit based on the specific disease, context of use, magnitude of the effect, the number of CRs , the durability of response, the disease setting, the 
location of the tumors, available therapy, and the risk-benefit relationship.   
3. Complete Response 
 
 CR is defined as no detectable evidence of tumor.  CR is generally measured through imaging studies (e.g. , CT s cans) or through histopathologic assessment (e.g., bone marrow biopsy or breast 
cancer resection specimens).  Treatment effect measured by CR can be a surrogate endpoint to support accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint to support traditional approval, or it can 
represent direct clinical benefit based on the specific disease, context of use, magnitude of the

 10 effect, effect duration, disease setting, location of disease, available therapy, and the risk -benefit 
relationship.  For hematologic malignancies such as acute leukemia, CR has been used as a clinical 
endpoint for traditional approval.  For early high- risk breast cancer, pathologic CR (pCR) has been 
used as a surrogate endpoint for accelerated approval.   
4. Time to Progression and Progression- Free Survival 
 TTP and PFS have served as primary endpoints for drug approval.  TTP is defined as the time from randomization until objective tumor progression; TTP does not include deaths.  PFS is defined as the time from randomization until objective tumor progression or death, whichever occurs first .  The precise definition of tumor progression is important and should be carefully 
detailed in the protocol.  Compared with TTP, PFS is the preferred regulatory endpoint.  PFS includes deaths and thus can be a better correlate to overall survival.  In TTP analysis, death events are censored, either at the time of death or at an earlier visit representing informative censoring (nonrandom pattern of loss from the study).  PFS assumes that death events are randomly related to tumor progression. 
 
PFS can reflect tumor growth and be assessed before the determination of a survival benefit.  Its 
determination is not confounded by subsequent therapy.  For a given sample size, the magnitude of effect on PFS can be larger than the effect on overall survival.  Data are usually insufficient to allow a robust evaluation of the correlation between effects on overall survival and PFS.  Cancer trials are often small, and proven survival benefits of existi ng drugs are generally mo dest.  
Treatment effect measured by PFS can be a surrogate endpoint to support accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint to support traditional approval, or it can represent direct clinical benefit based on the specific disease, context of use, magnitude of the effect, the disease setting, location of metastatic sites, available therapy,  the risk -benefit relationship,  and the clinical consequences of 
delaying or preventing progression in key disease sites (e.g., delay of new lesions in the brain or spine) or delaying administration of more toxic therapies.  
 It is important to carefully define tumor progression criteria in the protocol.  There are no standard regulatory criteria for defining progression.  Applicants have used a variety of different criteria,  including the RECIST criteria.   The broad outline presented in most published PFS 
criteria should be supplemented with additional details in the protocol and statistical analysis 
plan ( SAP).   
 Because progression data can be collected from multiple sourc es (including physical exams at 
unscheduled visits and radiological scans of various types) and at different times, data collection for each assessment visit should be limited to a specified short time interval around the scheduled visit.  Difficulties can  arise in determining the event date and censoring date when 
data are collected over a prolonged time period.  We recommend assigning the progression date to the earliest time when any progression is observed without prior missing assessments and censoring  at the date when the last radiological assessment determined a lack of progression.  
The guidance for i ndustry Clinical Trial Endpoints for the Approval of Non-Small Cell Lung 
Cancer Drugs and Biologics , Appendices C and D provides a set of tables for pote ntial analyses 
of PFS that can be used for primary or sensitivity analyses.  Plans for PFS data collection and analysis should be discussed with FDA at end-of- phase 2 meetings.  
 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 
 
 11 5. Time to Treatment Failure  
 
Time to treatment failure ( TTF) is defined as a composite endpoint measuring time from 
randomization to discontinuation of treatment for any reason, including disease progression, treatment toxicity, and death.  TTF is generally not recommended as a regulatory endpoint for new molecular entity drug appr oval.    
 
C. Endpoints Involving Symptom Assessment  
 
Symptomatic improvement is considered a clinical benefit.  FDA drug approvals have used 
patient symptom assessments and/or physical signs representing symptomatic improvement (e.g., weight gain, decreased effusion) as an important efficacy endpoint.  For the improvement of signs and symptoms or other clinical outcome assessments (COA) to be used as efficacy  
endpoints to support cancer drug approval, symptoms should be assessed  that are due to cancer 
rather than drug toxicity to the extent possible.   
 
1. Specific Symptom Endpoints 
 
Symptom improvement/palliation is a direct measure of clinical benefit rather than a surrogate endpoint.  A decrease in the severity of cancer symptoms has been used to support traditional approval of anti- cancer agents where anti -tumor activity has also been demonstrated.  The use of 
a symptom palliation endpoint requires that the population be symptomatic  at baseline, which 
can be problematic in many cancer trials where patients can often be asymptomatic at baseline.  This endpoint can also be subject to open label response bias, the magnitude of which is not well described.    
 Time to progression of cancer symptoms , an endpoint similar to TTP, is also a direct measure of 
clinical benefit rather than a potential surrogate  endpoint.  As discussed earlier, problems in 
measuring progression (e.g., missing assessments) also exist in evaluating time to symptomatic progression.  Because few cancer trials are blinded, symptom assessments can also be subject to 
response bias.  A delay between tumor progression and the onset of cancer symptoms can occur.  Often alternative treatments are initiated before achieving the symptom endpoint, confounding this analysis.  In addition, tumor symptoms can be difficult to differentiate from drug toxicity.  A composite symptom endpoint or symptom scale should have components of similar clinical 
importance and an analysis of the contribution of the components should be submitted with the primary analysis of the overall composite endpoint.  An example is the composite symptom scale that includes several important symptoms of myelofibrosis, the myelofibrosis symptom assessment fo rm.
20  An example of a composite endpoint for clinical events exists  for patients 
with cancer metastases to the skeleton.  Drugs have been approved based on delaying the time to skeletal -related events defined as pathological fractures, radiation therapy to  bone, surgery to 
bone, and spinal cord compression.

 12 Selection of the appropriate population can be critical for documenting symptom benefit. 
Patients symptomatic at study baseline can be evaluated with a categorical symptom response analysis.   In asymptomatic patients at baseline, a time -to-first-symptom analysis can be used , 
although this approach can be limited by intermittent missing data and discontinuation of the study drug prior to symptomatic progression. 
  
 
2. Problems Encountered with Symptom Data 
 Missing data and infrequent assessments can complicate the evaluation of symptom data particularly for time to deterioration analyses.  Procedures should be put in place to maximize completion rate during trial conduct and the statistical analysis plan should outline how missing data will be handled.  Data collection to support multiple symptom endpoints should be addressed prospectively regarding multiple hypotheses testing and the necessary statistical adjustments should be specified in the SAP.  Additional information on the use of patient-reported outcomes can be found in the guidance for industry Patient Reported Outcome Measures: Use in Medical Product Development to Support Labeling Claims .     
 
D. Blood or Body Fluid- Based Biomarkers  
 Generally, b iomarkers assayed from blood or body fluids have not served as primary endpoints 
for cancer drug approval, although paraprotein levels measured in blood and urine have been used as part of myeloma response criteria, and durable major molecular response is a surrogate endpoint used for traditional approval for therapies in chronic myelogenous leukemia.   The FDA has accepted blood-based markers as elements of a composite endpoint.  The occurrence of certain clinical events (a significant decrease in performance status, or bowel obstruction) in conjunction with marked increases in CA-125 was considered progression in ovarian cancer patients.  In addition, blood-based biomarkers can be useful in identifying prognostic factors and in selection of patients and stratification factors to be considered in study designs.  
E. Emerging Endpoints  
 In addition to the endpoints discussed in this section, FDA recognizes that advances in science are facilitating development of oncology products, which may also result in the identification of additional endpoints that may be used to support approval of oncology products.  As examples, minimal residual disease
21 has been used as a surrogate endpoint for accelerated approval for a 
therapy in acute lymphoblastic leukemia and metas tasis-free survival has been used as a clinical 
endpoint for traditional approval for a therapy in non- metastatic castration -resistant prostate 
cancer.  If a sponsor is planning to use an emerging endpoint in its clinical development program, we recommend discussing such use with the applicable FDA Division or Office prior to initiating a trial (see section V).

treatment of specific hematologic malignancies.  When finalized this guidance will represent FDA current thinking 
on the topics it addresses.    Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 
 
 13  
IV. CLINICAL TRIAL DESIGN AND ANALYSIS CONSIDERATIONS  
 Per 21 CFR 314.126, the FDA approves drugs based on substantial evidence of efficacy from “adequate and well -controlled investigations,” as described in the regulations.  Studies must 
allow a valid comparison to a control and must provide a quantitative assessment of the drug’s effect.
22  The most reliable method for demonstrating efficacy is to show a statistically 
significant improvement in a clinically meaningful endpoint in randomized controlled trials (i.e., superiority).  The following sections discuss other approaches that may be indicated when a randomized controlled trial demonstrating superiority is not feasible or ethical.  If a sponsor is planning to use one of these approaches, we recommend discussing such use with the applicable FDA Division or Office prior to initiating a trial (see section V).  
 
A. S
ingle -Arm Studies  
 In settings where there is no available therapy and where major tumor regressions can be presumed to be attributed to the tested drug, the FDA has sometimes accepted  ORR and 
response duration observed in single- arm studies as substantial evidence supporting accelerated 
approval.  Response rates have been used in settings such as acute leukemia for traditional approval where CRs  have been associated with decreased tran sfusion requirements, decrease in 
infections, and increased survival.  Single -arm trials do not adequately characterize time -to-
event endpoints such as overall  survival, DFS (and EFS), TTP, or PFS.  Because of variability 
in the natural history of many for ms of cancer, a randomized study is necessary to evaluate 
time-to-event endpoints. 
 
B. Randomized Studies Designed to Demonstrate Noninferiority  
 
A noninferiority (NI) trial should demonstrate the new drug’s effectiveness by showing that the new drug is not l ess effective than a standard regimen (the active control) by a prespecified 
amount ( noninferiority margin).
23  This noninferiority margin should be a clinically acceptable 
loss that is not larger than the effect of the active control drug.  The standard regimen should have a well -characterized clinical benefit (survival benefit).  If the new drug is inferior to the 
active control by more than the noninferiority margin, it will be presumed to be ineffective.  NI trials rely on external ly controlled (historical) data to establish the active control’s treatment 
effect size.   In cancer trials, this effect frequently has not been adequately characterized.   NI 
trials also rely on constancy assumption.  This assumption includes that the active- control effect 
has remained constant between the externally controlled  study and the current study.  This 
assumes constancy of patient population characteristics, supportive care measures, and 
evaluation techniques between the current trial and the externally controlled  data f rom which the 
active- control effect was derived.  The estimated size of the active- control’s treatment effect 
should be based on a compre hensive meta -analysis of externally controlled  studies.  These 
studies should reliably reproduce the active- control effect  compared with placebo arm. 
                                                 
22 See 21 CFR 314.126(b)(2) and (7).   
23 See guidance for industry Non -Inferiority Clinical Trials to Establish Effectiveness .  See  also the ICH  guidance for  
industry E10 Choice of Control  Group and  Related  Issues. 
 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 
 
 14 Difficulties in conducting NI trials include the estimation of active -control effect and the 
determination of amount of effect (NI margin) to be retained.  NI trials usually involve large 
sample sizes compared with superiorit y trials and involve replication of clinical trial results. 
Furthermore, subsequent therapies and crossover to the active-control arm can confound any NI 
analysis.  NI trials with endpoints other than overall survival and ORR are problematic.  
 
C. Trial Designs for Radiotherapy Protectants and Chemotherapy Protectants 
 Radiotherapy protectants and chemotherapy protectants are drugs designed to ameliorate the toxicities of therapies.  These trials usually have two objectives.  The first is to assess the amelioration of cancer treatment toxicity.  The second objective is to determine whether 
anticancer activity is compromised by the protectant.  The second objective usually examines earlier  endpoints; for example, ORR or PFS , rather than overall survival. 
 
D. Clinical Trial Design Considerations  
 The methodology for assessing, measuring, and analyzing the endpoint(s) should be detailed in the protocol and SAP .   
 Visits and radiological assessments, when applicable, should be symmetric between the two study arm s to prevent systematic bias.  The FDA and the applicant should agree prospectively on 
the following items and the applicant should finalize the items before the initiation of the study, to the extent possible:  
• The study design  
• The definition of progression 
• The SAP  
• The methodology for handling missing data and censoring methods 
• The data to be recorded on the case report form (CRF)  
• The operating procedures of an independent endpoint review committee (IRC), if applicable (see Appendix)  
 
E. C
linical Trial Analys is Issues 
 Missing data can complicate endpoint analysis.  For endpoints based on tumor assessments, the protocol should define an adequate assessment visit for each patient (i.e., a visit when all scheduled tumor assessments have been done).  The analysis  plan should outline a comparison of 
the adequacy of follow- up in each treatment arm.  Methodology for analyzing incomplete and/or 
missing follow -up visits and censoring methods should be specified in the protocol.  The analysis 
plan should specify the pri mary analysis and one or more sensitivity analyses to evaluate the 
robustness of the results.  Although any analyses with missing data can be problematic, the results can be strengthened by similar results in both the primary and the sensitivity analyses.  When applicable, the evaluation should include the number of deaths in patients who have been lost to follow -up for a prolonged time period.  For example, an imbalance in such deaths could 
bias a PFS measurement by overestimating PFS in the treatment arm with less follow -up. 
  Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 
 
 15 V. CONCLUSION 
 
Although the general principles outlined in this guidance should help applicants select endpoints 
for marketing applications, we recommend that applicants meet with the FDA before submitting 
protocols intended to support NDA or BLA marketing applications.  The FDA will  ensure that 
these meetings include a multidisciplinary FDA team of oncologists, statisticians, clinical pharmacologists, and external expert consultants as needed.  Applicants can submit protocols after these meetings and request a special protocol assess ment that provides confirmation of the 
acceptability of endpoints and protocol design to support drug marketing applications.
24  
Ultimately, of course, marketing approval depends not only on the design of clinical trials, but on FDA review of the results an d data from all studies in the drug marketing application.

 16 APPENDIX: INDEPENDENT REVIEW OF TUMOR EN DPOINTS  
 
Clinical trial results that support drug approval should be verifiable by applicants and the Food 
and Drug Administration ( FDA ).  Objective response r ate (ORR) determined in single -arm 
studies can be evaluated by reviewing a limited number of images.  When drug approval is 
based on measurement of progression- free survival ( PFS), careful planning can minimize bias 
and enable the applicant and t he FDA to verify results.  An independent endpoint review 
committee ( IRC) can minimize bias in radiographic interpretation of the radiological findings 
and independent adjudication of assessments.  A clearly written plan of the charter outlining the 
IRC fu nction and process (independent review charter) should be in place before initiation of 
the study.  The plan should describe the assurance of the committee’s independence and 
procedure for collection, storage, and transportation of the results.  The charter also should 
include the resolution of differences in interpretation and incorporation of clinical data in the 
final interpretation of data and audit procedures.  The use of an IRC is discussed further in the 
guidance for industry Developing Medical Imagi ng Drug and Biological Products, Part 3: 
Design, Analysis, and Interpretation of Clinical Studies .

 1Guidance for Industry1 
Expedited Programs for Serious Co nditions – Drugs and Biologics 
 
 
This guidance represents the Food and Drug Administrati on’s (FDA’s) current thinking on this topic.  It 
does not create or confer any rights for or on any pe rson and does not operate to bind FDA or the public.  
You can use an alternative approach if the approach  satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes 
and regulations.  If you want to discuss an alterna tive approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for 
implementing this guidance.  If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate 
number listed on the title page of this guidance.  
 
 
I. INTRODUCTION  
 
The following four FDA programs are intended to  facilitate and expe dite development and 
review of new drugs2 to address unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-
threatening3 condition: fast track designation, brea kthrough therapy design ation, accelerated 
approval, and priority review designation (see section IV  for an overview of the programs).  The 
purpose of this guidance for industry is to prov ide a single resource fo r information on FDA’s 
policies and procedures for these four programs as well as threshol d criteria generally applicable 
to concluding that a drug is a candidate for th ese expedited development and review programs.   
 FDA’s guidance documents, including this guid ance, do not establish legally enforceable 
responsibilities.  Instead, guidances describe th e Agency’s current thinki ng on a topic and should 
be viewed only as recommendations, unless spec ific regulatory or stat utory requirements are 
cited.  The use of the word should  in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or 
recommended, but not required.   
II. BACKGROUND 
 
The programs described in this guidance are intende d to help ensure that  therapies for serious 
conditions are approved and available to patien ts as soon as it can be concluded that the 
therapies’ benefits justify their risks.  The Ag ency first formally articulated its thinking on 
expediting the availability of promising new therap ies in regulations codified at part 312, subpart 
E ( 21 CFR part 312).
4  The  subpart E regulations are intended to  speed the availability of new 
therapies to patients with serious  conditions, especially when ther e are no satisfactory alternative 
therapies, while preserving appropriate standards for safety and effectiveness.  The regulations 
                                                 
1 This guidance has been prepared by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) in cooperation with the 
Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) at the Food and Drug Administration. 
2 For the purposes of this guidance, all references to drugs  or drug products  include both human drugs and 
biological drug products regulated by CDER and CBER unless otherwise specified.

conditions.

 2call for earlier attention to drugs that have pr omise in treating such c onditions, including early 
consultation with FDA for sponsors of such pr oducts and efficient tr ial design, potentially 
relying on well-controlled phase 2 studies for evidence of effectiveness.  The subpart E 
regulations specifically recognize that patients  and physicians are generally willing to accept 
greater risks and side effects from  treatment of life-threatening a nd severely debilitating diseases 
than they would for other diseases.  The four pr incipal programs that support these principles are 
fast track designation, breakthr ough therapy designation, accelerated approval, and priority 
review designation (referred to in  this guidance as the Agency’s expedited programs ). 
 FDA has a history of applying the philosophy under lying subpart E to drugs for rare diseases 
through use of the Agency’s expedited programs.  FDA recognizes that ce rtain aspects of drug 
development that are feasible for common diseases may not be feasible for rare diseases and that 
development challenges are often greater with increasing rarity of the disease.  FDA will 
continue to apply flexibility in these situati ons to address particular challenges posed by each 
disease.  
III. CONCEPTS FOR EXPEDITED PROGRAMS 
 
The programs that are the subject of this guida nce, fast track designa tion, breakthrough therapy 
designation, accelerated approval, and pr iority review, are summarized in section IV  and 
described individually in detail in sections V, VI, VII, and VIII.  All four expedited programs 
represent efforts to address an unmet medical need  in the treatment of a serious condition, which 
is discussed in the following paragraphs.   
 
A. Serious Condition 
 
1. Whether a Condition Is Serious 
 
FDA intends to interpret the term serious  as it has done in the past for the purposes of 
accelerated approval5 and expanded access to investigational drugs for treatment use.6  A serious 
disease or condition is defined in the expanded access regulations as follows: 
 
. . . a disease or condition associated with morbidity that has substantial impact on day-to-day fu nctioning.  Short-lived and self-
limiting morbidity will usually not be sufficient, but the morbidity need not be irreversible if it is persistent or recurrent.  Whether a 
disease or condition is serious is  a matter of clinical judgment, 
based on its impact on such factors as survival, day-to-day functioning, or the likelihood that the disease, if left untreated, will 
progress from a less severe condition to a more serious one.

 Note: For the purposes of this guidance, the terms condition, disease , and  illness are used 
interchangeably.  All conditions meeting the de finition of life-threatening as set forth at 
§ 312.81(a) would also be serious conditions. 
 
2. Whether the Drug Is Intended to Treat a Serious Condition 
 
As referenced in section IV , the statutory and regulatory el igibility criteria for expedited 
programs require that a drug be in tended to treat a serious condition.  To satisfy this criterion, a 
drug must be intended to have an effect on a se rious condition or a seriou s aspect of a condition, 
such as a direct effect on a serious manifest ation or symptom of a condition or other intended 
effects, including the following:  
 
 A diagnostic product intended to improve diagnos is or detection of a serious condition in 
a way that would lead to improved outcomes 
 
 A product intended to mitigate or prevent a se rious treatment-related side effect (e.g., 
serious infections in patients re ceiving immunosuppressive therapy) 
 
 A product intended to avoid or diminish a seri ous adverse event associated with available 
therapy for a serious condition (e.g., product that  is less cardiotoxic than available cancer 
therapy)8 
 
 A product intended to prevent a serious c ondition or reduce th e likelihood that the 
condition will progress to a more serious condi tion or a more advanced stage of disease 
 
B. Available Therapy  
 
For purposes of this guidance, FDA generally considers available therapy  (and the terms existing 
treatment  and existing therapy ) as a therapy that: 
 
 Is approved or licensed in the United States for the same indication being considered for 
the new drug9 and 
 
 Is relevant to current U.S. standa rd of care (SOC) for the indication 
                                                 
8 Sponsors considering an expedited drug development designation or program for a drug intended to avoid a serious 
adverse event associated with available therapy or diminish  its severity should be aw are that they will need to 
provide data that directly support the effect corresponding to th e level of evidence needed to meet the qualifying 
criteria for the relevant designation or program (e.g., phase 3 data demonstrating lower incidence or severity of the serious adverse reaction compared to ava ilable therapy for priority review).  Th e requisite data may be very difficult 
to obtain in early development, particularly for purposes of breakthrough therapy designation.   
9 There may be a substantial number of approved therapies with varying relevance to how a serious disease is 
currently treated in the United States, including therapies that are no longer used or are used rarely.  Only in 
exceptional cases will a treatment that is not approved for th e indicated use or is not FD A-regulated (e.g., surgery) 
be considered available therapy.  In those cases, FDA may consider an  unapproved or unlicensed therapy to 
constitute available therapy if the safety and effectiveness of the use is supported by compelling evidence, including 
extensive evidence in the published literature (e.g., certain well-established oncologic treatments).   Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 
 
 
 
 4 
FDA’s available therapy determination generally focuses on treatment options that reflect the 
current SOC for the specific indi cation (including the disease stage)  for which a product is being 
developed.  In evaluating the current SOC, FDA considers recommendations by authoritative 
scientific bodies (e.g., National Comprehens ive Cancer Network, American Academy of 
Neurology) based on clinical eviden ce and other reliable information that reflects current clinical 
practice.  When a drug development program targ ets a subset of a broader disease population 
(e.g., a subset identified by a gene tic mutation), the SOC for the br oader population, if there is 
one, generally is considered available therapy fo r the subset, unless there is evidence that the 
SOC is less effective in the subset.    Over the course of new drug development, it is  foreseeable that the SOC for a given condition 
may evolve (e.g., because of approval of a new therapy or new information about available therapies).  FDA will determine what constitutes available therapy at the time of the relevant 
regulatory decision for each expedited program a sponsor intends to use (e.g., generally early in 
development for fast track and breakthrough ther apy designations, at time of biologics license 
application (BLA) or new drug a pplication (NDA) submissions fo r priority review designation, 
during BLA or NDA review for accelerated approv al).  FDA encourages sponsors to discuss 
available therapy considerations with the Agen cy during interactions with FDA.       
 As appropriate, FDA may consult with special Government employees or other experts when 
making an available therapy determination.  When determining whether a drug granted accele rated approval or approved with a risk 
evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) that in cludes elements to assure safe use (ETASU) 
under section 505-1 of the Federal Food, Drug, a nd Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 355-
1), is considered available therapy, the following principles will be applied:  
 A drug would not be considered available th erapy if the drug is granted accelerated 
approval based on a surrogate endpoint or an in termediate clinical endpoint and clinical 
benefit has not been verified by postapproval studies.  (See section III.C.3. ) 
 
 A drug would be considered available therapy if the drug is granted accelerated approval 
because of restricted distribution and the study population for the new drug under 
development is eligible to receive the a pproved drug under the restricted distribution 
program.  Similarly, a drug would be consider ed available therapy if the study population 
for the new drug under development is eligib le to receive the approved drug under the 
ETASU REMS. 
 
C. Unmet Medical Need 
 
An unmet medical need is a condition whose treatment or diagnosis is not addressed 
adequately by available therapy.  An unme t medical need includes an immediate need 
for a defined population (i.e., to treat a seriou s condition with no or limited treatment) or 
a longer-term need for society (e.g., to a ddress the development of resistance to 
antibacterial drugs).   Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 
 
 
 
 5 
1. Where There Is No Available Therapy  
 
If there is no availabl e therapy for a serious c ondition, there is clearly an unmet medical need. 
 
2. Where There Is Available Therapy  
 
When available therapy exists for a condition, a ne w treatment generally w ould be considered to 
address an unmet medical need if the treatment:  
 Has an effect on a serious outcome of the c ondition that is not known to be influenced by 
available therapy (e.g., progressi ve disability or disease pr ogression when the available 
therapy has shown an effect on symptoms, but  has not shown an effect on progressive 
disability or disease progression) 
 
 Has an improved effect on a serious outcome(s ) of the condition compared with available 
therapy (e.g., superiority of th e new drug to available therapy when either used alone or 
in combination with availa ble therapy (i.e., as demons trated in an add-on study)) 
 
 Has an effect on a serious outcome of the condi tion in patients who are unable to tolerate 
or failed to respond to available therapy   
 Can be used effectively with other critical agents that cannot  be combined with available 
therapy 
 
 Provides efficacy comparable to those of av ailable therapy, while (1) avoiding serious 
toxicity that occurs with available thera py, (2) avoiding less serious  toxicity that is 
common and causes discontinuation of treatment  of a serious condition, or (3) reducing 
the potential for harmful drug interactions  
 Provides safety and efficacy comparable to those of availabl e therapy but has a 
documented benefit, such as improved compliance, that is expected to lead to an 
improvement in serious outcomes 
 
 Addresses an emerging or anticipated public  health need, such as a drug shortage 
 
In some disease settings, a drug that is not shown to provide a direct effica cy or safety advantage 
over available therapy may nonethel ess provide an advantage that would be of sufficient public 
health benefit to qualify as meeting an unmet medical need.  For example, in a condition for 
which there are approved therapies that have a mode st response rate or significant heterogeneity 
in response, a drug with a novel m echanism of action (but comparab le safety and effectiveness) 
could have the potential to  provide an advantage over available th erapy in some patients.  In such 
a case, the novel mechanism of action should have  a well-understood relati onship to the disease 
pathophysiology.  In addition, there should be a reas onable basis for concluding that a significant 
number of patients may respond differently to th e new drug compared with available therapy.  
Thus, mechanistic diversity, even  without a documented efficacy or safety advantage, could be Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 
 
 
 
 6advantageous in disease settings in which drugs become less effective or ineffective over time.  
For example, infectious disease drugs or target ed cancer therapies with novel mechanisms of 
action, although appearing to have efficacy sim ilar to available therapy across the disease 
population, could benefit patients who no longer respond to available therapy.  Accordingly, 
FDA intends to consider a range of potential advantages over availa ble therapy beyond those 
shown in head-to-head comparisons.       
3. Where the Only Available Therapy Was Approved Under the Accelerated 
Approval Program Based on a Surrogate Endpoint or an Intermediate Clinical Endpoint and Clinical Benefit Has Not Yet Been Verified 
 
As discussed in sections VII  and III.B. , FDA recognizes, as a general ma tter, that it is preferable 
to have more than one treatment approved under the accelerated approval provisions because of 
the possibility that clinical benefit may not be ve rified in postapproval co nfirmatory trials.  FDA 
will therefore consider products as addressing an unmet medical need if the only approved 
treatments were granted accelerated approval base d on a surrogate endpoint or an intermediate 
clinical endpoint and clini cal benefit has not been veri fied by postapproval studies.Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

 9V. FAST TRACK DESIGNATION 
 
Section 506(b) of the FD&C Act provides for the designation of a drug as a fast track product    
“. . . if it is intended, whether alone or in comb ination with one or more other drugs, for the 
treatment of a serious or  life-threatening disease or condition, and it demons trates the potential to 
address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition.”   This provision is intended to 
facilitate development and expedite review of  drugs to treat serious  and life-threatening 
conditions so that an approved product can reach the market expeditiously.  This section 
describes the qualifying criteria and the features of fast track designation.  Appendix 1  describes 
the process for fast track designation.   
 
A. Qualifying Criteria for Fast Track Designation 
 
Fast track designation applies to the drug (either alone or in co mbination with other drugs) and 
the specific use for which it is being studied.  The term drug  refers to the combination of two or 
more drugs if the combination is the subject of  the fast track designa tion or request.  Where 
appropriate, FDA may grant designation to the de velopment of a new use of an approved drug.  
 
1. Serious Condition 
 
See section III.A . 
 
2. Demonstrating the Potential to  Address Unmet Medical Need  
 
The type of information needed to demonstrat e the potential of a dr ug to address an unmet 
medical need will depend on the stage of drug de velopment at which fast track designation is 
requested.  Early in development, evidence of activity in a nonclinical model, a mechanistic 
rationale, or pharmacologic data could be used  to demonstrate such potential.  Later in 
development, available clinical  data should demonstrate the po tential to address an unmet 
medical need.  See section III.C . 
 
B. Features of Fast Track Designation 
 
1. Actions to Expedite De velopment and Review  
 
There are opportunities for frequent  interactions with the review team for a fast track product.  
These include meetings with FDA, including pr e-IND meetings, end-of-p hase 1 meetings, and 
end-of-phase 2 meetings to discuss study design, extent of safety data required to support 
approval, dose-response concerns, and use of biomarkers.  Other meetings may be scheduled as 
appropriate (e.g., to discuss accelerated approval, the structure and content of an NDA, and other 
critical issues).    In addition, such a product could be  eligible for priority review if supported by clinical data at 
the time of BLA, NDA, or e fficacy supplement submission (see section VIII ). 
 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 
 
 
 
 102. Submission of Portions of an Application (Rolling Review) 
 
If FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by a sponsor, that a 
fast track product may be effective, the Ag ency may consider reviewing portions of a 
marketing application before the sponsor  submits the complete application (see Appendix 
2).10 
 
VI. BREAKTHROUGH THERAPY DESIGNATION 
 
Section 506(a) of the FD&C Act provides for de signation of a drug as a breakthrough therapy    
“. . . if the drug is intended, alone or in combina tion with 1 or more other drugs, to treat a serious 
or life-threatening diseas e or condition and prelim inary clinical evidence indicates that the drug 
may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on 1 or more clinically 
significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical 
development.”  It is important to recogni ze that the standard for breakthrough therapy 
designation is not the same as the standard for dr ug approval.  The clinical evidence needed to 
support breakthrough designation is preliminary.  In contrast, as is the case for all drugs, FDA 
will review the full data submitted to support approval of drugs designated as breakthrough 
therapies to determine whether the drugs are safe and effective for their intended use before they 
are approved for marketing.  This section describes the qualifying criteria and the features of 
breakthrough therapy designation.  Appendix 1  describes the process for breakthrough therapy 
designation. 
 Not all products designated as breakthrough ther apies ultimately will be shown to have the 
substantial improvement over available therapies s uggested by the preliminary clinical evidence 
at the time of designation.  If the designation is  no longer supported by subsequent data, FDA 
may rescind the designation.
11  Because FDA commits significant resources to work particularly 
closely with sponsors of breakth rough therapy products, the Agency needs to focus its resources 
on breakthrough therapy drug deve lopment programs that continue to meet the program’s 
qualifying criteria (see section B.5. in Appendix 1 ).   
 
A. Qualifying Criteria for Brea kthrough Therapy Designation 
 
Breakthrough therapy designation ap plies to the drug (either alone or in combination with other 
drugs) and the specific use for which it is being studied.  The term drug  refers to the combination 
of two or more drugs if the co mbination is the subject of the breakthrough therapy designation or 
request.  Where appropriate, FDA may grant designa tion to the development of a new use of an 
approved drug.

 112. Existing (or Available) Therapies 
 
See section III.B . 
 
3. Preliminary Clinical Evidence 
 
Unlike the information that coul d support fast track designation, wh ich could include theoretical 
rationale, mechanistic rationale (based on nonclinical data), or evidence of nonclinical activity, 
breakthrough therapy designation requi res preliminary clinical evidence  of a treatment effect that 
may represent substantial improvement over availa ble therapies for the treatment of a serious 
condition.  For purposes of br eakthrough therapy designation, preliminary clinical evidence  
means evidence that is sufficient to indicat e that the drug may demonstrate substantial 
improvement in effectiveness or safety over av ailable therapies, but in most cases is not 
sufficient to establish safety and effectiveness fo r purposes of approval.  FDA expects that such 
evidence generally would be derived from phase 1 or 2 trials.  Nonclinical information could 
support the clinical evid ence of drug activity.  In all cases, preliminary clinical evidence 
demonstrating that the drug may represent a s ubstantial improvement over available therapy 
should involve a sufficient number of patients to  be considered cred ible.  However, FDA 
recognizes that the data cannot be expected to  be definitive at the time of designation.   
 Ideally, preliminary clinical evidence indica ting a substantial improvement over available 
therapies would be derived from a study that comp ares the investigationa l drug to an available 
therapy (or placebo, if there is no available therapy) in  clinical testing or from a study that 
compares the new treatment plus SOC to the SOC alone.  FDA encourages sponsors to obtain 
some preliminary comparative data of this type early in development.  Other types of clinical 
data that also could be persua sive include single-arm studies co mparing the new treatment with 
well-documented historical experien ce.  Generally, FDA expects that  such historically controlled 
data would be persuasive only if there is a large difference between the new treatment and 
historical experience.  For example, where lung function decline is a ma jor manifestation of a 
disease, single-arm study data showing that a new drug signifi cantly increases lung function 
could be persuasive if there is no available therapy that increases lung function.  Data 
demonstrating that a cancer drug substantially increases overall response rate compared with 
historical controls (e.g., historic al response rate with available therapy), with consideration of 
duration of the response, also could be persuasive .  Sponsors contemplating the use of historical 
controls should consult F DA’s ICH guidance for industry E10 Choice of Control Group and 
Related Issues in Clinical Trials  for more-detailed discussions.

 12To support a breakthrough therapy designation, the pr eliminary clinical evid ence must show that 
the drug may demonstrate substantial improveme nt over available therapy on one or more 
clinically signifi cant endpoints.   
 Substantial Improvement :  The determination of whether th e improvement over available therapy 
is substantial is a matter of judgment and depe nds on both the magnitude of  the drug’s effect on a 
clinically significant endpoint (whi ch could include duration of th e effect) and the importance of 
the observed effect to the treatment of the serious  condition or serious aspe ct of the condition.  In 
general, the preliminary clinical  evidence should show a clear adva ntage over available therapy.   
 Approaches to demonstrating substan tial improvement include the following: 
 
 Direct comparison of the new drug to availa ble therapy shows a much greater or more 
important response (e.g., complete responses  where the control treatment generally 
results only in partial responses ).  Such a trial could be conducted in treatment-naïve 
patients or in those whose disease failed to re spond to available therapies, either as a 
comparison with the failed therapy (if ethi cally acceptable) or as a no-treatment 
controlled study. 
 
 If there is no available therapy, the new drug shows a substantial and clinically 
meaningful effect on an important outcome when compared with a placebo or a well-
documented historical control. 
 
 The new drug added to available therapy resu lts in a much greater or more important 
response compared to available therapy in a controlled study or to a well-documented 
historical control.  This tr ial also could be conducted in treatment-naïve patients or in 
those whose disease failed to res pond to available therapies.   
 
 The new drug has a substantial and clinically  meaningful effect on the underlying cause 
of the disease, in contrast to available therap ies that treat only symp toms of the disease, 
and preliminary clinical evid ence indicates that the drug is  likely to have a disease-
modifying effect in the long term (e.g., a su stained clinical benefit compared with a 
temporary clinical benefit provi ded by available therapies).  
 
 The new drug reverses or inhibits disease pr ogression, in contrast to  available therapies 
that only provide symptomatic improvement. 
 
 The new drug has an important safety advantag e that relates to seri ous adverse reactions 
(e.g., those that may result in treatment interru ption) compared with available therapies 
and has similar efficacy.  
Clinically Significant Endpoint :  For purposes of breakthr ough therapy designation, FDA 
considers clinically sign ificant endpoint  generally to refer to an endpoi nt that measures an effect 
on irreversible morbidity or mortality (IMM) or on symptoms that represent serious consequences of the disease.  It can also refe r to findings that suggest  an effect on IMM or 
serious symptoms, including: Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 
 
 
 
 13 
 An effect on an established surrogate endpoint  that typically woul d be used to support 
traditional approval 
 
 An effect on a surrogate endpoint or intermediate clinical endpoint (see section VII.B.2 .) 
considered reasonably likely to predict a c linical benefit (i.e., th e accelerated approval 
standard)  
 A significantly improved safety profile compar ed with available therapy (e.g., less dose-
limiting toxicity for an oncology agent), with evidence of similar efficacy   
 In a breakthrough therapy designatio n request, a sponsor should provi de justification for why the 
endpoint or other finding s should be considered clinically significant. 
 In rare cases, a pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarker may be considered a cl inically significant 
endpoint if it strongly suggests th e potential for a clinically mean ingful effect on the underlying 
disease.  In such cases, a sponsor should provide evidence supporti ng the use of the PD 
biomarker.  Such evidence should include, for ex ample, (1) the extent of understanding of the 
disease pathophysiology, (2) whether the biomar ker is on a causal pathway of the disease 
process, and (3) the time course of the drug’s e ffect on the biomarker (e.g., the biomarker can be 
measured earlier than a surrogate endpoint us ed for accelerated approval).  In addition, strong 
evidence of the drug’s effect on the PD biomarker generally is expected.  FDA is more likely to 
rely on a PD biomarker for breakthrough therapy de signation in a disease se tting in which there 
is no available therapy, if the ev idence supports such use.   
  
B. Features of Breakthr ough Therapy Designation 
 
1. Intensive Guidance on an Efficient Drug Development Program, Beginning as 
Early as Phase 1 
 As discussed previously, breakthrough therapy designation will usually mean that the effect of 
the drug will be large compared with availabl e therapies.  In such cases, the development 
program for the breakthrough therapy could be considerably shorter than for other drugs 
intended to treat the disease being studied.  However, FDA notes that a compressed drug 
development program still must generate adequate data to demonstrate that  the drug is safe and 
effective to meet the statut ory standard for approval.
13  Omitting components of the drug 
development program that are necessary for such a determination can significantly delay, or even 
preclude, marketing approval.  Sponsors can design efficient clinical  trials in a number of ways.  FDA will seek to ensure that a 
sponsor of a product designated as  a breakthrough thera py receives timely advice and interactive 
communications to help the sponsor design and conduct a drug development program as 
                                                 
13 Section 505(d) of the FD&C Act and section 351(a) of the Public Health Service Act.  Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 
 
 
 
 14efficiently as possible.14  During these interactions, the Ag ency may suggest, or a sponsor may 
propose, alternative clinical tr ial designs (e.g., adaptive design s, an enrichment strategy, 
crossover or N-of-1 design, use of historical controls) or use of an interim analysis by a data 
monitoring committee.15  These trial designs may result in smaller trials or more efficient trials 
that require less time to complete and may help  minimize the number of patients exposed to a 
potentially less efficacious treatment (i.e., the co ntrol group treated with available therapy).  
Such approaches may be especially useful in st udies in rare diseases.  For example, single-arm 
trials may be an important option in rare di seases with well-unders tood pathophysiology and a 
well-defined disease course.  FDA anticipates that the review  team and the sponsor will meet and interact throughout drug 
development to address these and other important i ssues at different phases of development.  In 
addition, a sponsor should be prepared for a more rapid pace for other aspects of the drug development (e.g., manufacturing (see section IX.A .), development of a necessary companion 
diagnostic (see section IX.D .)). 
 
2. Organizational Commitment Involving Senior Managers 
 
FDA intends to expedite the development and review of a breakthrough therapy by intensively 
involving senior managers and e xperienced review and regulator y health project management 
staff in a proactive, collaborative, cross-disc iplinary review.  Where appropriate, FDA also 
intends to assign a cross-disciplinar y project lead for the review team to facilitate an efficient 
review of the drug development program.  The cr oss-disciplinary project  lead will serve as a 
scientific liaison between memb ers of the review team (e.g., medical; clinical pharmacology; 
pharmacology-toxicology; chemistry, manufact uring, and controls (CMC); compliance; 
biostatistics), facili tating coordinated internal interacti ons and communications with a sponsor 
through the review division’s regul atory health project manager. 
 
3. Submission of Portions of an Application (Rolling Review) 
 
FDA has determined that it is appropriate for a drug designated as a breakthrough therapy to be 
able to obtain rolling review.  Therefore, if  FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of 
clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a br eakthrough therapy product ma y be effective, the 
Agency may consider reviewing portions of a ma rketing application before the sponsor submits 
the complete application (see Appendix 2 ).  
 
4. Other Actions to Expedite Review 
 
                                                 
14 As noted in IX. GENERAL CONSID ERATIONS, it is important that sponsors respond promptly to FDA 
inquiries, which may include, for example, requests for information on various aspects of the drug development 
program. 
15 For more discussion of alternative clinical trial designs, see the draft guidance for industry Adaptive Design 
Clinical Trials for Drugs and Biologics  and the draft guidance for industry Enrichment Strategies for Clinical Trials

the time of BLA, NDA, or efficacy supplement submission. 
 
VII. ACCELERATED APPROVAL 
 
The accelerated approval provisions of FDASIA in section 506(c) of the FD&C Act provide that 
FDA may grant accelerated approval to:  
. . . a product for a serious or life-thre atening disease or condition . . . upon a 
determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably 
likely to predict clinical benef it, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier 
than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on 
irreversible morbidity or mortality or othe r clinical benefit, ta king into account the 
severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative 
treatments. 
 For drugs granted accelerated appr oval, postmarketing confirmatory trials have been required to 
verify and describe the anticipated eff ect on IMM or other c linical benefit (see sections VII.D.2.  
and VII.D.3. ).16   
 
This section describes the qualifyi ng criteria, relevant terms, and the conditions of accelerated 
approval.  The provisions of FDASIA facilitate so mewhat broader use of accelerated approval to 
expedite patients’ access to important treatment s for serious conditions.  FDA believes the new 
provisions provide additional flex ibility concerning the implications of available therapy on 
eligibility for accelerated approval (see section VII.A.2. ).  They also provide clarification 
concerning the use of clinical e ndpoints (herein referred to as inte rmediate clinical endpoints) as 
a basis for accelerated approval (see section VII.B.2. ).  In addition, the new provisions make 
clear that FDA has the authority to consider pharmacologic or other evidence developed using 
biomarkers or other scientific methods or tools,  in conjunction with other data, in determining 
whether an endpoint is reas onably likely to predict clin ical benefit (see section VII.C. ).17  By 
indicating that FDA should take in to account, “. . . the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the 
condition . . .” in considering whether to gran t accelerated approval, FDASIA reinforces the 
Agency’s longstanding commitment to regulatory flexibility regarding the evidence required to 
support product approval for the treatment of serious or life-th reatening diseases with limited 
therapeutic options.  The accelerated approval pathway has been used prim arily in settings in which the disease course 
is long and an extended period of time would be re quired to measure the in tended clinical benefit 
of a drug.  For example, accelerated approval has b een used extensively in the approval of drugs 
to treat a variety of cancers and human immunode ficiency virus (HIV) di sease where an effect

reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit.  FDASIA provides that FDA may consider “. . . epidemiological,

 16on tumor growth or viral load ca n be assessed rapidly, but demonstr ating an effect on survival or 
morbidity generally requires lengthy and sometimes  large trials because of the duration of the 
typical disease course.  Accelerat ed approval is also potentially us eful in acute disease settings 
where the intended clinical bene fit can be demonstrated only in  a very large study because the 
clinical event that would need to  be evaluated to demonstrate clin ical benefit occurs rarely.  For 
example, accelerated approval could be used for an acute condition where an effect on a surrogate endpoint could be shown in a small num ber of patients, but a much larger study would 
be needed to show the effect on a clinical outcome, such as survival.   FDA encourages sponsors to communicate with th e Agency early in development concerning the 
potential eligibility of a drug for accelerat ed approval, proposed surrogate endpoints or 
intermediate clinical en dpoints, clinical trial designs, and planning a nd conduct of confirmatory 
trials.  A sponsor seeking accelerated approval ma y also need to prepare for a more rapid pace 
for other aspects of the drug development (e.g., manufacturing (see section IX.A .),  development 
of a necessary companion diagnostic (see section IX.D. )). 
 
A. Qualifying Criteria for Accelerated Approval 
 
At the time a product is granted accelerated approval, FDA has dete rmined that an effect on the 
endpoint used to support approval––a surrogate e ndpoint or an intermedia te clinical endpoint––is 
reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit.  The principal risk of this ap proach is the possibility 
that patients will be exposed to a drug that u ltimately will not be shown to provide an actual 
clinical benefit.  In addition, ther e generally will be fewer, smaller,  or shorter clinical trials than 
is typical for a drug receiving tr aditional approval, which may generally mean there is less 
information about the occurrence of rare or dela yed adverse events.  Uncertainty about whether 
clinical benefit will be verified and the possibi lity of undiscovered risks are the primary reasons 
that accelerated approval is reserved for drugs  intended to treat a serious condition and that 
appear to provide a meaningful a dvantage over available therapy.   
 
1. Serious Condition 
 
See section III.A . 
 
2. Meaningful Advantage O ver Available Therapy 
 
The accelerated approval regulations state that accelerated approval is available only for drugs 
that provide a meaningful therapeu tic benefit over existing treatments.18  The accelerated 
approval provisions of section 901 of FDASIA (amending section 506 of the FD&C Act) require 
FDA to “. . .tak[e] into account . . . the availa bility or lack of alte rnative treatments.”   
 Amended section 506(c) clarifies the Agency’s flexibility in administering the accelerated 
approval program.  For example, an alternative therapy with efficacy comparable to available 
therapy, but with a different mechanism of action, could be of added clinic al value in a disease 
setting in which a significant number of patients may respond differently to the new therapy.  
The discussion of unmet medical need in section III.C.2.  provides examples of situations in

 17which a drug could be shown to provide a meaningful advantage over available therapy, 
including some in which there may not be a demons trated direct efficacy or safety advantage.  
Section III.B.  describes what constitutes available therapy when determining whether a drug 
provides a meaningful advantage. 
  
3. Demonstrates an Effect on an Endpoint That Is Reasonably Likely to Predict 
Clinical Benefit  
 
These endpoints are discussed in section VII.B .  The basis for determining whether an endpoint 
is reasonably likely to predict clinic al benefit is discussed in section VII.C . 
 
B. Accelerated Approval Endpoints 
 
The two types of endpoints that can be used as  a basis for accelerate d approval are:  (1) a 
surrogate endpoint that is considered reasonably likely to predict clin ical benefit and (2) a 
clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier th an IMM that is reasonably likely to predict an 
effect on IMM or other c linical benefit (also see section VII.D.2. ).  For purposes of this 
guidance, these categories of e ndpoints are referred to as surroga te endpoints and intermediate 
clinical endpoints,  respectively.   
 A clinical endpoint is a characterist ic or variable that directly m easures a therapeutic effect of a 
drug––an effect on how a patient feels (e.g., symptom relief), functions (e.g., improved mobility), or survives.     A clinical benefit is a positive therapeutic effect that is clinically meaningful in the context of a given disease.  The clinical be nefit must be weighed against a treatment’s risks to determine 
whether there is an overall be nefit for patients (i.e., a posit ive benefit-risk profile). 
 
1. Surrogate Endpoints  
 
For purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate  endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory 
measurement, radiographic image, physical sign, or  other measure, that is thought to predict 
clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of c linical benefit.  Dependi ng on the strength of the 
evidence supporting the ability of a marker to predict clinical benefit, the marker may be a 
surrogate endpoint that is known to  predict clinical benefit (a va lidated surrogate endpoint that 
could be used for traditional approval), a surrogate  endpoint that is reasonab ly likely to predict a 
drug’s intended clinical benefit (and that coul d therefore be used as a basis for accelerated 
approval), or a marker for which there is insuffi cient evidence to support reliance on the marker 
as either kind of surrogate e ndpoint (and that therefore cannot be  used to support traditional or 
accelerated approval of a ma rketing application).   
 Examples of surrogate endpoints that FDA has us ed to support accelerated approval include the 
following:  
 Prolonged suppression of HIV viral load in  plasma has been shown to reduce the 
morbidity and mortality associated with HIV disease and has been the basis for Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 
 
 
 
 18traditional approval.  Shorter-term suppression of viral load has been used in the past as a 
surrogate to support ac celerated approval because it was co nsidered reasonably likely to 
predict an effect on morbidity or mortalit y.  Data now demonstrate that short-term 
suppression of viral load may support fu ll approval, in some circumstances.19 
 
 Clearance of bacteria from the blood stream as evidenced by a laboratory measurement of 
bacteria in the blood has been considered reasonably likely to pr edict the clinical 
resolution of infection.  
 Outcomes of 6-month follow-up treatment (i .e., sputum culture status and infection 
relapse rate) have been c onsidered reasonably likely to  predict the resolution of 
pulmonary tuberculosis. 
 
 Decrease in iron stores for patients with iron overload caused by thalassemia has been 
considered reasonably likely to predict a de crease in transfusion-related adverse events 
caused by iron overload in the body.  
 Radiographic evidence of tumor shrinkage (r esponse rate) in certain cancer types has 
been considered reasonably likely to predict an improvement in overall survival. 
 
2. Intermediate Clinical Endpoints  
 
For purposes of accelerated approval, an intermed iate clinical endpoint is a measurement of a 
therapeutic effect that can be measured earl ier than an effect on IMM and is considered 
reasonably likely to predict the drug’s effect on IMM or other cl inical benefit.  An important 
question is whether the demonstrated therapeuti c effect alone would be a basis for traditional 
approval.  Approvals for products for serious c onditions based on clinical endpoints other than 
IMM will usually be considered under traditional appr oval procedures.  Approvals based on such 
clinical endpoints will be considered under th e accelerated approval pa thway only when it is 
essential to determine effects on IMM or other clinical benefit in  order to confirm the predicted 
clinical benefit that led to approval. Although FDA has limited  experience with  accelerated 
approvals based on intermediate c linical endpoints, FDA believes intermediate clinical endpoints 
generally could be used to support acceler ated approval in s ituations such as: 
 
 A study demonstrates a relatively  short-term clinical benefit in a chronic disease setting 
in which assessing durability of the clinical benefit is essential for traditional approval, 
but the short-term benefit is considered reas onably likely to predic t long-term benefit. 
 
 A clinical endpoint demonstrates a clinical benefit that is reas onably likely to predict an 
effect on IMM in a disease setting in which it is essential to confirm the effect on IMM 
(e.g., because available therapy ha s established effects on IMM). 
 
                                                 
19 See the draft guidance for industry Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 Infec tion: Developing Antiretroviral Drugs 
for Treatment.  When final, this guidance will represent FDA's current thinking on this topic.   Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 
 
 
 
 19Examples of cases in which FDA has used an  intermediate clinical endpoint to support 
accelerated approval include the following: 
 
 A treatment for multiple sclerosis was approved based on a large therapeutic effect on 
relapse rate through approximately 13 mont hs of treatment, but where there was 
uncertainty about the durability of the obser ved effect.  Under accel erated approval, the 
sponsor was required to conti nue the existing trials into the postmarketing period to 
confirm durability of the observed effect at 2 years.   
 A treatment for preterm labor was approve d based on a demonstration of delay in 
delivery.  Under accelerated approval, the s ponsor was required to conduct postmarketing 
studies to demonstrate improved long-term postnatal outcomes.  
 FDA will not grant accelerated approval to products that meet standards for traditional approval.  
Sponsors considering a development program for accelerated approval based on an intermediate 
clinical endpoint should  discuss their development program w ith the appropriate review division 
early in drug development.   
C. Evidentiary Criteria for Accelerated Approval 
 
Drugs granted accelerated approval must meet th e same statutory standards for safety and 
effectiveness as those granted traditional approval.
20  For effectiveness, the standard is 
substantial evidence based on adequate and well-controlled clinical investigations.21  For safety, 
the standard is having sufficient information to determine whether the drug is safe for use under 
conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling.22  Under accelerated 
approval, FDA can rely on a particular kind of ev idence, such as a drug’s effect on a surrogate 
endpoint, as a basis for approval.  FDA carefully evaluates such evidence to ensure that any 
remaining doubts about the relationship of the eff ect on the surrogate to clinical benefit are 
resolved by additional posta pproval studies or trials.23  An application for accelerated approval 
should also include evidence that a proposed surr ogate endpoint or an intermediate clinical 
endpoint is reasonably likely to predict th e intended clinical benefit of a drug.   
 Determining whether an endpoint is  reasonably likely to predict cl inical benefit is a matter of 
judgment that will depend on the biological plausibi lity of the relationshi p between the disease, 
the endpoint, and the desired effect and the empiri cal evidence to support that relationship.  The 
empirical evidence may include “. . . epidem iological, pathophysiological, therapeutic, 
pharmacologic, or other evidence developed using biomarkers, for example, or other scientific 
methods or tools.”
24  Evidence of pharmacologic activity alone is not sufficient, however.25  
Clinical data should be provided to support a conclusion that a re lationship of an effect on the

 20surrogate endpoint or intermediate clinical endpo int to an effect on the clinical outcome is 
reasonably likely.   In making the judgment as to whether a drug’s e ffect on a given endpoint is reasonably likely to 
predict clinical benefit, FDA considers all releva nt evidence and may consult external experts, as 
needed.  This guidance provides an overview of some of the important factors to consider in 
identifying and assessing the predictive potential of surrogate endpoints or intermediate clinical 
endpoints.  This guidance does not , however, address the specific clinical evidence needed to 
support a conclusion that a particul ar surrogate endpoint or interm ediate clinical endpoint is 
reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or IM M because such evidence is case-specific and is 
not readily generalizable.   
1. Understanding of the Disease Process 
 
Surrogate endpoints are often thought to be a measure of the following, for example: 
 The underlying cause of the disease (e.g., elev ated uric acid and gout, elevated blood 
pressure and hypertensive cardiovascular  disease, low thyroxine levels and 
hypothyroidism, high ammonia levels  and urea cycle disorders) 
 
 An effect that predicts the ultimate outcome  (e.g., tumor shrinkage could be expected to 
delay symptomatic progression and improve su rvival, diuresis coul d be expected to 
improve symptoms of heart fa ilure, effects on serum creatin ine or glomerular filtration 
rate (if not transient or reversible) ar e accepted surrogates for predicting effects on 
chronic renal disease and de laying the occurrence of end-stage renal disease) 
 
 The state of the pathophysiologic pathway leading to the clinical outcome (e.g., low 
levels of the biomarker that increase with replacement of a missing enzyme or clotting 
factor)  
In such cases, the extent to which the pathophysio logy of a disease is und erstood is an important 
factor in determining whether an en dpoint is reasonably likely to pr edict clinical benefit.  If the 
disease process is complex, has multiple pathoph ysiologic or causal pathways, and is poorly 
understood, it may be difficult to determine whether an effect on a surrogate endpoint represents 
a meaningful effect on the causal pathway.  Fo r example, for some reasonably well-understood 
enzyme deficiencies, replacement of the deficient en zyme reliably predicts clinical benefit.  In 
contrast, other enzyme deficien cies may involve a defect fo r which the pathophysiologic or 
causal pathways are not well understood and wher e enzyme replacement as measured by blood 
levels, but not tissue levels, will not reasonably predict the disease course or treatment results.  
 
Some effects on well-establishe d, disease-related biomarkers
26 may have little or no ability to 
predict clinical benefit or their ability to predic t benefit may vary depend ing on the disease or the 
                                                 
26 FDA's CDER has established the Biomar ker Qualification Program to support work with external scientists and 
clinicians in developing biomarkers.  The Biomarker Qualification Program offers a formal process to guide 
submitters as they develop biomarkers and rigorously evaluate  them for use in the regulatory process.  Details on the Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 
 
 
 
 21intervention.  For example, in a patient with a fever caused by an infectious disease, a fall in a 
patient’s body temperature in response to a non-s teroidal anti-inflammato ry drug does not predict 
the drug’s effect on the disease.  However, a fa ll in a patient’s body temperature in response to 
an antibiotic may be an indicati on of an effect on the disease.  Similarly, in prostate cancer, 
increased levels of prostate-sp ecific antigen (PSA) may be the re sult of advancing tumor burden.  
Therefore, PSA may be correlate d with the progression of pros tate cancer and the risks of 
mortality.  However, the relationship between  increasing PSA and disease progression and 
morbidity is not uniform.  Thus the ability of a drug to lower PSA levels cannot necessarily be 
relied upon to predict the drug’ s clinical benefit.    
 
2. Understanding of the Relationship Betw een the Drug’s Effect and the Disease 
Process 
 
The extent to which a drug’s effect on the surrog ate endpoint is known to pr edict an effect on the 
disease either because the effect is on the causal pathway or correlates with  clinical outcomes is 
critical.  Sometimes this relationship can be  assessed epidemiologically but it is most 
persuasively established by knowing that a drug that  affects the surrogate endpoint also affects a 
clinical outcome.  Thus, loweri ng blood pressure has been shown repeatedly, with a wide variety 
of drugs, to reduce the incidence of stroke and cardiovascular di sease in people with 
hypertension.  Similarly, killing infecting bacteria or viruses l eads to curing infectious disease 
and shrinking a tumor for a sustained period can lead  to improved survival in patients with some 
cancers.  These surrogate endpoint responses ar e thus understood to have positive effects on the 
disease process.  
Examples of factors to consider  in identifying and asse ssing a surrogate endpoi nt thus include the 
following:   
 Whether there is reliable and consiste nt epidemiologic evidence supporting the 
relationship between the endpoint an d the intended clinical benefit.
27 
 
 How precisely the epidemiologic relationship between the endpoint a nd clinical outcome 
is defined.  For example, the extent to which an abnormal endpoint corresponds to a 
worse clinical outcome, as is the case fo r blood pressure and lo w-density lipoprotein 
(LDL) cholesterol.  (The stronger the corre lation between the abnormality and clinical 
outcome, the stronger the basis for concluding th at an effect on the endpoint would have 
a reasonably well-defined eff ect on the clinical outcome.) 
 
 Whether the effect on the surrogate endpoint ha s been shown to predic t a clinical benefit 
with another drug or drugs.  This factor would generally be more persuasive if the drug is 
in the same or a closely re lated pharmacological class.

27 Note, however, that such a relationship does not always pred ict a favorable effect, as illustrated by failure of drugs 
that effectively lower premature ventri cular beat rates or raise high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol to have 
the expected cardiovascular benefits.   Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 
 
 
 
 22 
Particularly in rare diseases, th ere may be limited information in th e literature, lack of in-depth 
epidemiological or historical data, and little or  no experience with othe r drugs to inform the 
interpretation of surrogate endpoints or intermed iate clinical endpoints.  FDA may consult with 
external experts on surrogate endpo ints and intermediate clinical endpoints where there is a lack 
of historical data for a given disease.28 
 
D. Conditions of Accelerated Approval 
 
1. Promotional Materials 
 
Unless otherwise informed by the Agency, an applicant must submit to the Agency for consideration during the pr eapproval review period copies of all promotional materials, including 
promotional labeling as well as advertisements, intended for dissemination or publication within 
120 days following marketing approval.
29  After 120 days following marketing approval, unless 
otherwise informed by the Agency, the applicant must submit promotional materials at least 30 
days prior to the intended time of initial dissemina tion of the labeling or in itial publication of the 
advertisement.30 
 
2. Confirmatory Trials 
 
For drugs granted accelerated appr oval, postmarketing confirmatory trials have been required to 
verify and describe the anticipated  effect on IMM or othe r clinical benefit.  These trials must be 
completed with due diligence.31   
 FDA has interpreted the due dili gence requirement to mean that  the postmarketing trial(s) 
intended to verify the clinical be nefit must be conducted promptly to facilitate determination, as 
soon as possible, of whether clin ical benefit has been verified.  The protocol for a postmarketing 
trial should be developed as early  as possible, and timelines for th e trial should be specified; for 
example, timelines for enrollment and trial comp letion should be stipul ated.  There should be 
agreement between FDA and the sponsor on the de sign and conduct of the confirmatory trial(s). 
 If it is clear during developmen t that a product is intended to  be approved under accelerated 
approval on the basis of a surrogate  endpoint or an intermediate clinical endpoint, confirmatory 
trial(s) should be underway at the time the market ing application is submitted.  If it is not clear 
until shortly before or after submission of a marke ting application that a surrogate endpoint or an 
intermediate clinical endpoint will be the proposed basis for a ccelerated approval, there should 
be agreement on the design and conduct of  such trial(s) before approval.  
 
                                                 
28 See, for example, section 569(a)(2), (b), and (c) of the FD&C Act, Consultation With External Experts on Rare 
Diseases, Targeted Therapies and Genetic Targeting of Treatments , which describes general consideration for 
consultation with external experts, topics for consultatio n, and classification as speci al Government employees.

31 Section 506(c)(3)(A) of the FD&C Act and §§ 314.510 an d 601.41.  Where confirmatory trials verify clinical 
benefit, FDA generally will terminate the requirement (21 CFR 312.560 and 601.46). Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 
 
 
 
 23Generally, the confirmatory trial would evaluate  a clinical endpoint th at directly measures 
clinical benefit.  For example,  the confirmatory trial population would ordinarily be the same 
disease population that was studied  to support accelerated approval.   In some cases, however, the 
commercial availability of a drug following accele rated approval may make it difficult to enroll 
patients in the same disease population.  In these cases, a confirmatory trial may be conducted in 
a different but related population that is capable of  verifying the predicted clinical benefit.  This 
is often the case in oncology, wher e after accelerated appr oval of a drug for la te-stage disease is 
granted, the confirmatory trial is conducted in an earlier stage of the same cancer. 
 There are also cases in which additional evalua tion (longer duration) of the same surrogate 
endpoint that was used to suppor t accelerated approval (rather th an a clinical endpoint) in the 
same population could be persuasive evidence of c linical benefit.  For ex ample, in the case of 
HIV treatment, an effect on viral load of relati vely short duration (24 weeks) was considered 
reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit suppo rting accelerated approval.  An effect of longer 
(1 year) viral load suppression wa s more convincingly related to dur able clinical benefit in the 
setting of lifelong therapy and thus was used to verify clinical benefit for traditional approval.
32 
 When it is possible to use a later effect in a trial to  verify the effect seen earlier in the same trial 
that supported accelerated approval, the same clini cal trial(s) can be used  to support accelerated 
approval and verify and describe the clinical benefit.  In this case , the protocol and the statistical 
analysis plan should clearly account for an analys is of the surrogate endp oint data to provide 
support for accelerated approval, w ith continuation of the randomi zed trial(s) to obtain data on 
the clinical endpoint that will be the basis for verifying the clin ical benefit.  When the same trial 
is used to support accelerated approv al and verify clinical benefit, the data to verify the clinical 
benefit may be, in some cases, nearly complete by the time of accelerated approval.  
3. Withdrawal of Accelerated Approval 
 
FDA may withdraw approval of a drug or indication approved under the accelerated approval 
pathway if,
33 for example: 
 
 A trial required to verify the predicted clinical be nefit of the product fails to verify such 
benefit.  
 
 Other evidence demonstrates that the product is  not shown to be safe or effective under 
the conditions of use.  
 
 The applicant fails to conduct any require d postapproval trial of the drug with due 
diligence.  
 
                                                 
32 Although an effect on viral load changes of short duration had been used in the past as a surrogate endpoint to 
support accelerated approval, FDA now considers this endpoint acceptable, in some  circumstances, to grant 
traditional approval based on years of experience with this endpoint. 
33 See section 506(c)(3) of the FD&C Act and §§ 314.530(a) and 601.43(a).  Part 314, subpart E and part 601, 
subpart H describe additional grounds for withdrawal. Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 
 
 
 
 24 The applicant disseminates false or mislead ing promotional materials relating to the 
product.   
 
Approval of a drug may be withdrawn if trials fail to verify clinical benefit or do not demonstrate 
sufficient clinical benefit to justify the risks a ssociated with the drug (e.g., show a significantly 
smaller magnitude or duration of benefit than wa s anticipated based on the observed effect on the 
surrogate).  If FDA determines there are grounds for withdr awal, the Agency may ask the applicant to 
request withdrawal of approva l under § 314.150(d) or notify the a pplicant of FDA’s proposal to 
withdraw approval in a notice of opportunity for hearing ( NOOH).  The NOOH generally will 
state the proposed grounds for withdrawal of approval.
34  Upon receipt of an NOOH, an 
applicant has 15 days to file a written request fo r a hearing.  If an applicant does not request a 
hearing within 15 days, the applicant waives its opportunity for hearing.35  An applicant may also 
request the Agency to withdraw approval of  an application appr oved under accelerated 
approval.36   
 
VIII. PRIORITY REVIEW DESIGNATION 
 
An application for a drug will recei ve priority review designation if it is for a drug that treats a 
serious condition and, if approve d, would provide a significant improvement in safety or 
effectiveness.  In addition, specific statutory prov isions provide for priority review for various 
types of applications, described in section IV .  A priority designation is intended to direct overall 
attention and resources to the evaluation of su ch applications.  This section describes the 
qualifying criteria and the features of priority review designation.  Appendix 1  describes the 
process for priority review designation.   
 
A. Qualifying Criteria for Priority Review Designation 
 
1. Serious Condition  
See section III.A . 
 
2. Demonstrating the Potential To Be a Significant Improvement in Safety or 
Effectiveness  
 
On a case-by-case basis, FDA determines at the time of NDA, BLA, or efficacy supplement 
filing whether the proposed drug would be a significant improvement  in the safety or 
effectiveness of the treatment, prevention, or diagnosis of a serious condition.  Significant 
improvement may be illustrated by the following examples:   
 Evidence of increased effectiveness in treatm ent, prevention, or diagnosis of a condition

36 21 CFR 314.150(c) and 601.5(a). Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 
 
 
 
 25 Elimination or substantial reduction of  a treatment-limiting adverse reaction  
 
 Documented enhancement of patient complia nce that is expected to lead to an 
improvement in serious outcomes  
 Evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation   
 
Although such evidence can come from clinical trials comparing a marketed product with the 
investigational drug, a priority review designation can be base d on other scientifically valid 
information.  Generally, if ther e is an availa ble therapy (see section III.B .), sponsors should 
compare their investigational drug to the available therapy in clinical test ing with an attempt to 
show superiority relating to either safety or e ffectiveness.  Alternativ ely, sponsors could show 
the drug’s ability to effectively treat patients who are unable to tolerate, or whose disease failed to respond to, available therapy or show that the drug can be used effectively with other critical 
agents that cannot be combined with availabl e therapy.  Although such showings would usually 
be based on randomized trials, other types of cont rols could also be persuasive, for example, 
historical controls.
37 
 
B. Features of Priority Review Designation 
 
A priority review designation means FDA’s goal is to take action on the marketing application 
within 6 months of receipt (compared with 10 months under standard review).  The PDUFA 
review clock for applications filed by  FDA under the Program is described in section IV . 
 
IX. GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
Communication with the Agency is a critical aspe ct of expedited programs.  FDA will strive to 
provide a timely response to a sponsor’s inquir y regarding an expedited development program.  
It is equally critical that a sponsor respond prom ptly to FDA’s inquiries.38  This applies to formal 
meetings and related inquiries, written corresponde nce, and other interactions.  In addition to the 
many types of formal meetings39 and correspondence the Agency offers to sponsors, additional 
considerations for sponsors of expedited pr ograms are highlighted in this section. 
 
A. Manufacturing and Product Quality Considerations 
 
The sponsor of a product that receives an expe dited drug development designation may need to 
pursue a more rapid manufacturing development program to accommodate the accelerated pace of the clinical program .  The sponsor’s product quality a nd CMC teams should initiate early 
                                                 
37 Sponsors contemplating the use of historical controls should consult ICH E10  for more-detailed discussions. 
38 For example, FDA may request updates on a breakthrough therapy designation program in order to provide the 
sponsor with guidance on drug development.   
39 See the guidance for industry Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Sponsors or Applicants .

 26communication with FDA to ensure that the ma nufacturing development programs and timing of 
submissions meet the Agency’s expectati ons for licensure or marketing approval.40   
 When sponsors receive an expedited drug developm ent designation, they should be prepared to 
propose a commercial manufacturing program that w ill ensure availability  of quality product at 
the time of approval.  The proposal should consider estimated market demand and the 
commercial manufacturing development plan.  Th e proposal should also consider manufacturing 
facilities and a lifecycle approach to proce ss validation.  Additionally, the proposal should 
include a timeline for development of the manufact uring capabilities with goals aligned with the 
clinical development program.  After the initial discussion fo llowing designation, frequent 
communication during development will generally facilitate meeting manufacturing development 
goals and product quality goals.    Sponsors of such products should allow for an ear lier submission of the CMC section (including 
product quality information) for timely review , and, critically, for inspection activities.
41  
Coordination with the sponsor and contract ma nufacturers may be necessary to ensure that 
manufacturing facilities and equi pment are ready for inspection dur ing review of the clinical 
section of the application.  A comprehensive m eeting with FDA’s product quality review groups 
in advance of submission may facilitate the quality assessment of products designated for 
expedited programs.     Although sponsors must ensure the availability of quality product at the time of approval, FDA may exercise some flexibility on the type and extent of manufacturing information that is 
expected at the time of submission and approva l for certain components (e.g., stability updates, 
validation strategies, inspection planning, manufacturing scale-up).  The level of flexibility will 
be determined on a case-by-case basis after consid eration of factors such  as the following: (1) 
product characteristics, (2) seriousness of the condition and medical need, (3) manufacturing 
processes, (4) the robustness of  the sponsor’s quality system, and (5) the strength of the 
sponsor’s risk-based quality assessment.  FDA’s consideration of the sponsor’s proposal for an 
integrated postmarketing plan will also take in to account whether elements  of the plan may be 
appropriately executed as a postmarketing commitment or requirement.  For example, FDA will consider impacts on clinical pe rformance, such as safety a nd immunogenicity.  Sponsors should 
meet with the Agency to discuss their proposed plan as soon as possibl e and no later than the 
pre-NDA or pre-BLA meeting. 
  
 
B. Nonclinical Considerations 
 
To ensure timely submission and review of nonc linical data, sponsors should initiate early 
communication with FDA for their nonclinical st udy programs.  Considerations such as study 
                                                 
40 See the guidance for industry IND Meetings for Human Drugs and Biologics Chemistry, Manufacturing, and 
Controls Information . 
41 For products designated as fast tr ack or breakthrough therap y, this can be accomplishe d through rolling review 
(see 2. Submission of Portions of an Application (Rolling Review), 3. Submission of Portions of an Application 
(Rolling Review), and Appendix 2: Processes for Rolling re view).  For products submitted under an NDA without 
such a designation, flexibility is permitted in § 314.50(d)(1 )(iv).  For BLAs without such a designation, there is 
flexibility also to allow an early submission of the CMC section when resources permit.

 27protocol modifications, sequence and scheduling of studies, and the need for specific studies 
(e.g., long-term toxicity) may be im portant in the contex t of expedited drug development.  FDA 
will provide guidance to sponsors on the developmen t of appropriate and timely nonclinical data 
needed to support an application for marketing approval or licensure.   
 
C. Clinical Inspection Considerations 
 
Sponsors should anticipate the Agency’s need to inspect clinical trials, including, if applicable, 
the analytical component of bioavailability or  bioequivalence studies.  Sponsors should be 
prepared for inspections to be scheduled by the Agency early in the app lication review process 
so inspection results are availabl e to inform the review division and to allow time for the sponsor 
to address significant inspection find ings.  To select sites for clin ical inspections, it is important 
for reviewers to have timely acce ss to adequate and accurate data in BLA, NDA, or supplement 
submissions.  Sponsors should initiate early  communication with FDA about information 
required for inspection pl anning and conduct.   
 
D. Companion Diagnostics 
 
Development programs utilizing one or more of  the expedited programs described in this 
guidance may involve an in vitro companion di agnostic device.  Sponsors using one of the 
expedited programs for a product that involves an  in vitro companion di agnostic device should 
consult FDA’s guidance on the topic.42 
 
X. PAPERWORK REDUCTION ACT OF 1995 
 
This guidance contains information collection provi sions that are subject to  review by the Office 
of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 
3501-3520).  The time required to complete this in formation collection is estimated to average 
30 hours per response to prepare a priority revi ew designation request and 70 hours per response 
to prepare a breakthrough thera py designation request, including th e time to review instructions, 
search existing data sources, gath er the data needed, and comple te and review the information 
collection.  Send comments regarding this burde n estimate or suggestions for reducing this 
burden to:  Food and Drug Administration Center for Drug Evaluation and Research Office of Medical Policy 10903 New Hampshire Avenue, Bldg. 51, rm. 6360 Silver Spring, MD 20993-0002

 28APPENDIX 1: PROCESSES FOR FAST TRACK, BREAKTHROUGH THERAPY, AND 
PRIORITY REVIEW DESIGNATIONS 
 
This appendix describes general processes applicable to the subm ission and review of fast track, 
breakthrough therapy, and prio rity review designations. 
 
A. Process for Fast Track Designation 
 
1. When to Send a Designation Submission 
 
Sponsors may request fast track designation when  the IND is first submitted or at any time 
thereafter before receiving marketing approva l of their BLA or NDA.  The IND and potential 
fast track designation may be di scussed before an IND submissi on in a pre-IND meeting, but a 
decision on designation would await submission of the IND.  As a practical matter, FDA should 
ordinarily receive a fast track  designation request no later than  the sponsor's pre-BLA or pre-
NDA meeting with the Agency because many of th e features of fast tr ack designation will not 
apply after that time.  If a s ponsor’s drug development program is  granted fast track designation 
for one indication and has subsequently obtaine d data to support fast  track designation for 
another indication, the sponsor shou ld submit a separate request. 
 
2. Where to Send a Designation Submission 
 
The IND or amendment should be sent to the IN D administrative file to  the attention of the 
appropriate review di vision or office in CDER or CBER.   
 
3. Content of a Designation Submission  
 
Fast track designation requests should contain the following information (in most cases, this 
information could be captured in approximately 10 to 20 pages):  
 
 If the fast track designation request is submitted to the sponsor’s IND as an amendment, 
identification of the submission in the cover letter as a REQUEST FOR FAST TRACK 
DESIGNATION  in bold, uppercase letters.  If the request is submitted with an initial 
IND, identification of the submission in the cover letter as both an INITIAL 
INVESTIGATIONAL NEW DRUG SUBMISSION  and REQUEST FOR FAST 
TRACK DESIGNATION  in bold, uppercase letters. 
 
 In the cover letter of the submission, the na me of the sponsor’s contact person and the 
contact person’s address, email addre ss, telephone number, and fax number. 
 
 If applicable, the I ND application number. 
 
 If available, for drug produc ts, the proprietary name a nd active ingredient and for 
biological products, the proper name and proprietary name. 
 
 The division or office to which the IND is being submitted or in which it is active. Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 
 
 
 
 29 The proposed indication(s). 
 
 A concise summary of information that supports  the fast track desi gnation request for the 
indication being studied, including the following: 
 
o The basis for considering the drug to be one intended to treat a serious condition 
 o The basis for considering the drug to ha ve the potential to  address an unmet 
medical need and an explanation of how this potential is being evaluated in the 
planned drug development program (e.g., a de scription of the trials intended to 
evaluate this potential) 
 
 If applicable, a list of documents previously submitted to the IND that is considered 
relevant to the designation request, with reference to submission dates.  Paper 
submissions can be resubmitted to FDA as  appendices to the designation request.  
 
4. FDA Response 
 
FDA will respond to fast track designation request s within 60 calendar days  of receipt of the 
request. 
 
a. Designation letter  
 If the Agency determines that the criteria for designation as a fast track drug development 
program have been met, the designation letter will:  
 State that fast track designa tion is granted for development of the product for use in 
treating the specific serious condition  
 Point out that the sponsor should design and perform studies that can show whether the 
product meets an unmet medical need 
 
 Alert the sponsor to the need for the drug development program to continue to meet the 
criteria for fast track designation 
 
b. Nondesignation letter  
If the Agency determines that a fast track de signation request was incomp lete or that the drug 
development program failed to meet the criteria for fast track designati on, the Agency will send a 
nondesignation letter to the sponsor.  The nondesi gnation letter will state that fast track 
designation is not granted and explain th e reasons for the Agency's decision.   
 
5. Continued Designation as a Fast Track Development Program 
 
Over the course of drug development, it can be expected that some produ cts granted fast track 
designation will not continue to m eet the criteria for fast track designation.  A drug product in a Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 
 
 
 
 30fast track development program ma y not continue to meet the crit eria if the drug: (1) no longer 
demonstrates a potential to address unmet medical need or (2) is not being studied in a manner 
that shows the drug product can treat a serious conditi on and meets an unmet medical need.  The 
drug product may no longer demonstrate a potential to address unmet medical need, for example, 
if a new product was approved under a traditional approval that addressed the same need or if 
emerging clinical data failed to show that the product in a fast  track development program had 
the anticipated advantage over available therapy.  For products in fast track drug development 
programs, the Agency expects that the appr opriateness of considering particular drug 
development plans as part of the fast track pr ogram will be discussed and evaluated during the 
drug development process, includ ing at the end-of-phase 2 m eeting and the pre-BLA or pre-
NDA meeting.  If the sponsor recognizes that the fast track drug deve lopment program will no 
longer be pursued, the sponsor should in form the Agency of this change. 
 When fast track designation is no longer s upported by emerging data or the designated drug 
development program is no longer being pursu ed, the Agency may choose to send a letter 
notifying the sponsor that the progr am is no longer designated as  a fast track drug development 
program.    
B. Process for Breakthrou gh Therapy Designation 
 
1. When to Send a Designation Submission 
 
Although sponsors may request breakthrough ther apy designation when the IND is first 
submitted or at any time thereafter, they should not send breakthrough therapy designation 
requests until they have preliminary clinical  evidence indicating that “. . . the drug may 
demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on 1 or more clinically significant 
endpoints.”
43  FDA therefore expects that in mo st cases breakthrough therapy designation 
requests would be submitted as an amendment to the IND.  Ideally, FDA should receive a breakthrough therapy designation request  before initiation of the clinical trial(s) intended to serve 
as the primary basis for demonstration of efficacy if  most of the benefits of designation are to be 
obtained.  Because the primary intent of breakth rough therapy designation is to develop evidence 
needed to support approval as efficiently as pos sible, FDA anticipates th at breakthrough therapy 
designation requests will rarely be  made after the submission of an original BLA or NDA or a 
supplement.  If a sponsor’s drug developm ent program is granted breakthrough therapy 
designation for one indication and has subsequently obtained prel iminary clinical evidence to 
support breakthrough therapy desi gnation for another indicatio n, the sponsor should submit a 
separate request.  If a sponsor has not requested breakthrough th erapy designation, FDA ma y suggest that the 
sponsor consider submitting a reque st if: (1) after reviewing ava ilable data and information, the 
Agency thinks the drug development program ma y meet the criteria for breakthrough therapy 
designation and (2) the remaining drug developmen t program and review can benefit from the 
designation.  However, the Agency still need s to review the submitted request (including 
preliminary clinical evidence) to determine if it meets the criteria for break through therapy 
designation.  A suggestion by the Agency that a sponsor consider submitting a request for 
                                                 
43 Section 506(a)(1) of the FD&C Act. Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 
 
 
 
 31breakthrough therapy designation is advisory and should not be interpreted as guaranteeing 
breakthrough therapy designation once a request is submitted and reviewed.  
2. Where to Send a Designation Submission 
 
The IND or amendment should be submitted to the I ND administrative file to  the attention of the 
appropriate review division or  office in CDER or CBER. 
 
3. Content of a Designation Submission 
 
Breakthrough therapy designation requests should  contain the following information (in most 
cases, this information c ould be captured in approximately 10 to 20 pages): 
 
 If the breakthrough therapy designation request is submitted to the sponsor’s IND as an 
amendment, identification of the submission in the cover letter as a REQUEST FOR 
BREAKTHROUGH THERAPY DESIGNATION  in bold, uppercase letters.  If the 
request is submitted with an initial IND, id entification of the submission in the cover 
letter as both an INITIAL INVESTIGATIONAL NEW DRUG SUBMISSION  and 
REQUEST FOR BREAKTHROUGH THERAPY DESIGNATION  in bold, 
uppercase letters.  
 
 In the cover letter of the submission, the na me of the sponsor’s contact person and the 
contact person’s address, email addre ss, telephone number, and fax number. 
 
 If applicable, the I ND application number. 
 
 If available, for drug produc ts, the proprietary name a nd active ingredient and for 
biological products, the proper name and proprietary name. 
 
 The division or office to which the IND is being submitted or in which it is active.  
 
 The proposed indication(s).  
 
 A concise summary of information that supports the breakthro ugh therapy designation 
request for the indication being studied, including the following: 
 
o The basis for considering the drug to be one intended to treat a serious condition 
 o The preliminary clinical evidence that the drug may demonstrate substantial 
improvement over available therapies.
44  FDA does not expect the sponsor to 
submit primary data (data sets); but, th e sponsor should describe the preliminary 
clinical evidence, including, fo r example, a brief descrip tion of available therapies 
(if there are any) and their effectiveness; justification for the comparator selected 
                                                 
44 If the designation is being submitted with the IND, examples  of information that could be submitted to support a 
designation request include data from foreign clinical tr ials not conducted under IND, a different formulation or 
route of administration, a use in an unrelated indication, or the published literature.   Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 
 
 
 
 32for the clinical studies,  the study design, the populati on studied, and the endpoint 
used; and a brief description of the study results and statistical analyses 
(including, for example,  subgroup analysis). 
 
 If applicable, a list of documents previously submitted to the IND that is considered 
relevant to the designation request, with reference to submission dates.  Paper 
submissions can be resubmitted to FDA as appendices to the designation request. 
 
4. FDA Response 
 
FDA will respond to breakthrough therapy design ation requests within 60 calendar days of 
receipt of the request. 
a. Designation letter  
 If the Agency determines that the criteria fo r designation as a breakthr ough therapy development 
program have been met, the designation letter will:   
 State that breakthrough therapy designation is granted for development of the product for 
use in treating the specific serious condition 
 
 Explain that FDA will work closely with th e sponsor to provide guidance on subsequent 
development, including providing advice on ge nerating evidence needed to support the 
drug approval in an efficient manner  
 Alert the sponsor to the need for the drug development program to continue to meet the 
criteria for breakthrough therapy designation 
 
b. Nondesignation letter  
 If the Agency determines that a breakthrough ther apy designation request wa s incomplete or that 
the drug development program failed to meet th e criteria for breakthrough therapy designation, 
the Agency will send a nondesignation letter to the sponsor.  The nondesignation letter will state 
that a breakthrough therapy designa tion is not granted and explain the reasons for the Agency’s 
decision.  Where appropriate, the letter may al so include advice to the sponsor regarding 
subsequent development, including what woul d be needed in a new breakthrough therapy 
designation request. 
 
5. Continued Designation as a Breakthrough Therapy Development Program 
 
Over the course of drug development, it can  be expected that some products granted 
breakthrough therapy designation will no longer be considered  a breakthrough therapy.  For 
example, a drug development program may be granted breakthrough therapy designation using 
early clinical testing th at shows a much higher response rate th an available therapies.  However, 
subsequent interim data derived from a larger study may show a response that is substantially 
smaller than the response seen in early clinical testing.  Anot her example is where breakthrough Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 
 
 
 
 33therapy designation is granted to tw o drugs that are being developed for the same use.  If one of 
the two drugs gains traditional ap proval, the other would not reta in its designation unless its 
sponsor provided evidence that the drug may demonstrate substantia l improvement over the 
recently approved drug.  Additionally, if the spons or recognizes that the development program 
designated as breakthrough therapy will no longer be pursued, the sponsor should inform the Agency of this change.  When breakthrough therapy designation is no longer supported by emerging data or the 
designated drug development program is no long er being pursued, the Agency may choose to 
send a letter notifying the sponsor that the program is no longer designated as a breakthrough 
therapy development program.  Consistent with FDA’s commitment to communicate frequently, 
and in an interactive manner, w ith sponsors of drugs designated as breakthrough therapies, FDA 
will notify the sponsor of its intent to rescind a nd will offer the sponsor an opportunity to justify 
its product’s continued designati on.  FDA recognizes that sponsors  of products that have had 
their breakthrough therapy designation rescinded b ecause available data no longer support the 
designation may still have sufficient evidence after completion of the drug development program to support marketing approval.  
C. Process for Priority Review Designation 
 
FDA determines whether an application qualifies fo r priority review (versus standard review) for 
every application, not just  when priority review is requested  by the applicant.  However, an 
applicant may expressly request  priority review as descri bed in the following sections. 
 
1. When to Send a Designation Submission 
 Sponsors may request priority re view designation when they submit an original BLA, NDA, or 
efficacy supplement.  The Agency does not anticip ate that priority revi ew designation requests 
will be made after the filing of a BLA, NDA, or efficacy supplement.      
 
2. Where to Send a Designation Submission 
 
Priority review designation requests may be subm itted with the original BLA, NDA, or efficacy 
supplement to the attention of th e appropriate review division or office in CDER or CBER.   
 
3. Content of a Designation Submission  
 
Priority review designation requests s hould contain the following information: 
 
 Identification of the submission in the cover letter as a REQUEST FOR PRIORITY 
REVIEW DESIGNATION  in bold, uppercase letters. 
 
 In the cover letter of the submission, the na me of the sponsor’s contact person and the 
contact person’s address, email address,  telephone number, and fax number.   
 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 
 
 
 
 34 If available, for drug produc ts, the proprietary name a nd active ingredient and for 
biological products, the proper name and proprietary name. 
 
 The proposed indication(s). 
 
 A concise summary of information that supports  the priority review designation request, 
including the following: 
 
o The basis for considering the drug to be intended to treat a serious condition 
 
o The basis for the assertion that the drug w ould be a significant improvement in the 
safety or effectiveness of the treatmen t, prevention, or diagnosis of a serious 
condition    
 
4. FDA Response 
 
FDA will inform the applicant in writing of a priority review designation by day 60 of the 
review.  The division will inform the applican t in writing of a standa rd review designation by 
day 74 of the review.  Applica tions that are not filed do not receive a review designation. 
 
5. Continued Priority Review Designation 
 
After priority review designation is assigned, the timeline will not change during the first review 
cycle, even if a redetermination of review stat us is made because of approval of other drugs, 
availability of new data, or submission of a request for formal dispute resolution by the 
applicant.  In addition, applications filed over protest are assigned a standard review.  If the 
application is resubmitted after FDA’s refuse-to-file  decision or if the application is withdrawn 
before FDA’s action and resubmitted, FDA will make its determination of review designation based on the resubmitted application.Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 
 
 35APPENDIX 2: PROCESSES FOR ROLLING REVIEW 
 
This appendix describes general processes applicable to the subm ission and review of portions of 
an application, a feature of  fast track designation (see section V.B.2 .) and breakthrough therapy 
designation (see section V1.B.3 .). 
 
A. Agreement on Proposal 
 
Sponsors obtain preliminary Agency agreemen t on the proposal at the pre-BLA or pre-NDA 
meeting or earlier for products with breakth rough therapy designation (e.g., end-of-phase 2 
meeting).  At the meeting, the sponsor and the review division should discuss: (1) the data 
that will be used to support effectiveness, (2 ) the schedule for submission of each portion of 
the BLA or NDA, and (3) a description of por tions of the applica tion to be submitted 
separately.    A request to submit portions of an applicati on ordinarily should be included in the 
information package for the pre-BLA or pre- NDA meeting.  If a sponsor seeks to submit 
portions of an application to  the IND after the pre-BLA or  pre-NDA meeting, the sponsor 
should make such a request and provide a propos ed schedule for submissi on of portions of an 
application to the IND as soon as possible. 
 A request for submission of portions of an applic ation should be sent as  an amendment to the 
IND; attach Form FDA 1571.  The amendmen t should be clearly identified as a REQUEST 
FOR SUBMISSION OF PORTIONS OF AN APPLICATION  in bold, uppercase letters.  
FDA responds to sponsors’ requests for submissi on of portions of an a pplication by letter.  
FDA also responds to changes to an agreement to  accept portions of an application by letter. 
 
B. Portions of an Application Eligible for Early Submission 
 
Generally, the Agency accepts for submission a complete section of a BLA or NDA only, 
such as the entire CMC section, toxi cology section, or clinical section.
45  A section of a BLA 
or NDA should be submitted for review in a form adequate to have been included in a 
complete BLA or NDA submission.  Drafts should not be included in a submission; if final 
reports need to be updated, the applicant shou ld submit a formal amendment to the BLA or 
NDA with the revised information.  Occasiona lly, the Agency may, in its discretion, accept 
less than a complete section if the Agency determines that such a subsection would constitute a reviewable unit and be useful in making the review process more efficient (e.g., less than a 
complete section could be a CMC section lack ing final consistency lot data and long-term 
stability data, a toxicology section lacking ch ronic toxicology data, final study reports for 
some or all of the principal controlled trials  without integrated summaries).  The sponsor 
should confirm these subsect ions are final reports. 
 At the pre-BLA or pre-NDA meeting, the Agency  and the sponsor should work together to 
clearly define the parameters of accepting an incomplete sect ion and to determine whether 
                                                 
45 Form FDA 356h may be a useful guide to items in a BLA or NDA. Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 
 
 36FDA could conduct a meaningful review of the submission before receiving the missing 
information.  
C. Submission of User Fees 
 
A sponsor is required to pay applicable fees as  stated in section 736 of the FD&C Act before 
FDA may commence review of any portion of an a pplication.  The applican t should submit Form 
FDA 3397 with applicable user fees and follow th e same procedures as those followed when a 
complete application is submitted.  
D. Commencement of Review 
 
If FDA accepts a portion of an a pplication, this does not necessa rily mean that review will 
commence or proceed before the complete applic ation is submitted.  Actual commencement and 
scheduling of review depends on many fact ors, including staffing, workload, competing 
priorities, timeline for completing the applicatio n, and the perceived efficiency of commencing 
review before receipt of the complete submission.  
E. Calculation of Review Time 
 
The review clock will not begin until the applicant informs the Agency that a complete BLA or NDA was submitted.
46  After the Agency is notified of the complete application, we will 
make a filing determination within the usual time.47 
 
                                                 
46 Section 506(d)(2) of the FD&C Act provides that any time period for review of human drug applications shall not 
apply until the date on which the application is complete.

This draft guidance, when finalized, will represent th e Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA’s) current 
9 thinking on this topic.  It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to 
10 bind FDA or the public.  You can use an alternative a pproach if the approach satisfies the requirements of 
11 the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want  to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA

18 I. INTRODUCTION 
19 
20 The purpose of this guidance is to outline the FDA’s current thinking on the principles of clinical 
21 development relevant to dose-selection and asse ssment of efficacy and safety to support the 
22 approval of drug products for the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).  It also 
23 addresses additional considerations for drug products developed as drug-device combination 
24 products. This guidance does not address nonc linical development, development of drug 
25 products for juvenile idiopath ic arthritis, or developmen t of biosimilar products.  
26 
27 This guidance revises the guidance for industry Clinical Development Programs for Drugs, 
28 Devices, and Biological Products for the Tr eatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) , published in 
29 February 1999.
2  After it has been finalized, this gu idance will replace the February 1999 
30 guidance and will reflect the current thinking of  the FDA on RA drug product development.  The 
31 FDA’s current thinking has been influenced by clinical development programs conducted for RA 
32 since the 1999 guidance published, and by changes in the standard  of care for RA because of 
33 availability of many effective trea tments.  The revisions include: 
34 
35  Dose(s) and dosing regimen(s) selection thr oughout the clinical de velopment program  
36 37  Expectations for establishing efficacy in RA  based on signs and symptoms and physical 
38 function domains 
1 This guidance has been prepared by the Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Rheumatology Products in the Center 
for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) in cooperation with the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research 
(CBER) and the Center for Devices and Radiological Hea lth (CDRH) at the Food and Drug Administration.  
2 We update guidances periodically.  To make sure you have the most recent version of a guidance, check the FDA

44 45  Use of active comparator for safety and efficacy trials 
46 47  Principles of safety assessment 
48 49  Development of drug-device combination products

51 This guidance does not discuss genera l issues of statistica l analysis or clinical  trial design.  Those 
52 topics are addressed in the ICH guidances for industry E9 Statistical Principles for Clinical 
53 Trials  and E10 Choice of Control Group and Related Issues in Clinical Trials , respectively. 
54 This guidance focuses on specific drug product de velopment and trial design issues that are 
55 unique to the study of RA. 
56 57 FDA’s guidance documents, including this guid ance, do not establish legally enforceable 
58 responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe th e Agency’s current thinki ng on a topic and should 
59 be viewed only as recommendations, unless spec ific regulatory or stat utory requirements are 
60 cited. The use of the word should  in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or 
61 recommended, but not required. 
62 63 
64 II. CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM 
65 66 A. Dose and Dosing Regimen Selection Considerations 
67 
68 The selection of nominal dose(s)  and dosing regimen(s) is a fundamental component of drug 
69 product development.  The recommended dose(s)  and dosing regimen(s) should be based on 
70 benefit-to-risk assessment and should be supported by all available data gathered throughout the 
71 development program.  It is important to find the appropriate nominal dose and dosing regimen 
72 that produces efficacy with an acceptable long - and short-term safety profile.  Many drug 
73 products intended to treat RA have  the potential to cause serious  dose-related adverse reactions, 
74 such as opportunistic infecti ons and malignancy, which may not be apparent in short-term 
75 clinical trials (see section II.C. for further disc ussion of the clinical sa fety database).  Dose-
76 ranging exploration should begin early in the development program and often should continue 
77 throughout definitive efficacy and safety study(ie s).  Smaller early dose-ranging exploratory 
78 studies may not be adequate for selection of  a single dose or a single dosing regimen.  
79 80 The following should be considered for the design of dose-ranging studies: 
81 
82  Studying a wide range of doses and dosi ng regimens based on pharmacokinetic and 
83 relevant pharmacodynamic considerations.

85  Using endpoints sensitive to change to pr ovide better discriminatory power for dose-
86 
87 response assessment.  A clinical endpoint su ch as the ACR20 response criteria may not 
be optimal for this purpose,3 because it is a dichotomous endpoint, and using the 
88 89 proportion of responders in a small group of pa tients could be unrelia ble.  Endpoints such 
as DAS28,
4 hybrid ACR response,5 and other continuous variab les may be more sensitive 
90 to change and provide a more suitable alternative to ACR responder index.  Supportive 
91 pharmacodynamic markers can be consider ed if scientifically justified. 
92 
93  Timing of evaluation — assessing at the steep  part of the dose-re sponse curve for dose-
94 response assessment.  Endpoints should be evaluated at time points before the therapeutic 
95 plateau is likely (e.g., weeks 2 through 8) to  better capture possibl e differences between 
96 doses. Later time points of evaluation (e.g., 12 weeks) may be informative in estimating 
97 clinical effect with chronic use. 
98 
99 B. Efficacy Considerations 
100 
101 To meet the regulatory standards for approval un der section 505(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, 
102 and Cosmetic Act, sponsors must provide substan tial evidence of efficacy in the enrolled patient 
103 population and demonstrate an acceptable risk-ben efit profile for their drug product (21 U.S.C. 
104 355(d)). Studying more than one dose/dosing regimen or using an active comparator in 
105 definitive studies can facilitate the interpre tation of efficacy and the overall risk-benefit 
106 evaluation. This section outlines the principles  sponsors should follow to assess efficacy of drug 
107 products for the treatment of RA.  
108 109 1. Establishing efficacy in key RA domains.  For marketing approval of drug products for 
110 the treatment of RA, sponsors should demonstrate substantial evidence of efficacy in the 
111 key RA domains: clinical response and physical function.  
112 
113  Clinical response.  ACR20 response criteria  continues to be an accepted measure to 
114 demonstrate reduction in RA disease activity.  In addition, higher levels of response, 
115 as measured by ACR50 and ACR70 response rates, and measures of low disease 
116 activity, such as DAS28 less than 2.6, can be used as supportive evidence of efficacy 
117 in the clinical re sponse domain.  
118 
3 ACR20 (50, 70) response criteria — American College of Rheumatology response criteria is a dichotomous 
composite endpoint indicating the proportion of patients with at least 20 (50, 70) percent improvement in the 
number of tender and swollen joints, and in three out of the remaining five ACR core-set measures: patient pain, 
patient global assessment of disease, physician global assessment of disease, physical functioning assessment 
(Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability In dex (HAQ-DI)), and acute phase reactants. 
4 DAS28 — Disease Activity Score 28 is a mathematical ly calculated, continuous, composite endpoint with 
differential weighting given to each of the following componen ts:  tender joint count (28 joints), swollen joint count 
(28 joints), acute phase reactant, and patient global assessment of arthritis. 
5 Hybrid ACR response is a continuous score of the mean  improvement in the core set measures combining the 
ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 response rates (American College of Rheumatology Committee to Reevaluate 
Improvement Criteria 2007).

Draft — Not for Implementation 
119  Physical function. Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability  Index (HAQ-DI) can 
120 be used to demonstrate improvement in physical function.6 
121 
122 Data from 12-week placebo-controlled clinical  trial(s) generally would be acceptable to 
123 provide evidence of efficacy in clinical re sponse and physical function domains.   
124 125 2. Other domains.  As noted in item 1 above, for marketing approval in RA, the 
126 foundational demonstration of efficacy should include clinical response and physical 
127 function using measures such as ACR20 response rates and HAQ-DI, respectively.  
128 Demonstration of efficacy in other domains that  are important to patients and health care 
129 providers can provide further characterization of the efficacy of the drug product and its 
130 utility in clinical practice.  Other domains can include: 
131 
132  Prevention of structural damage progression. Reduction in radiographic evidence of 
133 structural damage progression is an important predictor of long-term benefits in 
134 delaying or preventing the progression to disa bility related to RA.  Radiographic data 
135 using validated scoring methods have been used to demonstrate efficacy in this 
136 domain.  However, demonstration of prevention of structural damage progression on 
137 radiographs has become increasing ly difficult for several reasons:  
138 139  Use of placebo as a control in long-term trials (usually 6 months or longer for 
140 trials done in the past to demonstrat e effect on radiographic outcomes) is no 
141 longer feasible (see item 3 below) 
142 143  The extent of progression in the plac ebo group is low during these short-term 
144 trials, and thus the observed treatment e ffect size of the investigational drug 
145 product is small and difficult to detect  
146 147  Limitations of the current analysis methods   
148 
149 Therefore, sponsors should consider alternative study designs (e.g., active comparator 
150 studies), applying different measures (e.g., proportions of patients with radiographic 
151 progression), and alternative analytical met hods when assessing radiographic benefit.  
152 Other imaging modalities, such as magneti c resonance imaging and ultrasonography, 
153 may allow for demonstration of benefit on structural damage progression in 
154 controlled studies that may be shorter than studies using radiographic data.  However, 
155 these modalities have not been validated as  outcome measures in RA to date.   
156 
157  Clinical remission.  Remission is an important  goal of RA treatment.  The American 
158 College of Rheumatology/European L eague Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) 
159 Provisional Definition of Remi ssion criteria may be acceptable for use in RA clinical 
160 development programs (ACR/EULAR 2011).  Patients who achieve remission should 
161 be followed to provide some information on th e durability of the remission response.   
6 HAQ-DI assesses the degree of difficulty a patient has experienced during the past week in eight domains of daily 
living activities:  dressing and grooming, arising, eating,  walking, hygiene, reach,  grip, and other activities.

162 
163  Other aspects of RA. Othe r outcome measures may be informative as additional 
164 endpoints in RA clinical development pr ograms.  Sponsors should provide supportive 
165 evidence on the development of the selected measure.  Sponsors also should provide 
166 the justification for use of a given measure,  which should include importance, clinical 
167 relevance, and nonredundancy of the proposed outcome with other measures. 
168 
169 3. Use of placebo. Assessment of efficacy in some domains may require long-term 
170 controlled clinical trial data.  However, the availability of effective RA therapies and the 
171 shifting paradigm in the treatment of both ear ly and established RA with a focus on early 
172 control of disease activity (Singh 2012) have provided a rationale for limiting the 
173 exposure of patients to placebo or ineffec tive therapies for a prolonged period of time 
174 (i.e., beyond 12 weeks) (American College of Rheumatology  2011).  Therefore, studies 
175 longer than 12 weeks should include an active co mparator as the cont rol or provisions for 
176 escape to rescue treatment for patients with active disease. 
177 
178 C. Safety Considerations 
179 
180 The size of the safety database for drugs and biologic products should meet the minimum 
181 recommendations outlined in the ICH guidance for industry E1A The Extent of Population 
182 Exposure to Assess Clinical Safet y:  For Drugs Intended for Long- term Treatment of Non-Life-
183 Threatening Conditions . However, drug products develope d for RA may have potentially 
184 serious adverse effects that may cause concern.  Unfortunately, the duration of trials that would 
185 support demonstration of efficacy may not be su fficient for an adequate safety assessment 
186 because the short duration of a placebo-controlled period (i.e., 12 weeks) would limit the amount 
187 of controlled safety data. Therefore, to better  characterize the long-term safety profile of the 
188 investigational drug product and uncommon adverse events and events with longer latency 
189 periods, such as opportunistic infection and ma lignancy, we may request a premarket safety 
190 database of larger size and longer duration th an recommended in ICH E1A for new molecular 
191 entities intended for the chronic treatment of RA. 
192 193 This request will likely include at least 1 year of  controlled safety data for a new molecular entity 
194 with an active comparator arm to facilitate interp retation of these data.  Sa fety data for a shorter 
195 duration may be considered if the drug product is not a new molecular entity.  Reasonable 
196 comparator arms can include use of multiple doses of the investigational drug product or 
197 standard-of-care treatment in definitive clinical  trials.  Inclusion of more than one dose of 
198 investigational drug product can provide importa nt dose-response information with regard to 
199 efficacy and safety. For safety issues of in terest, sponsors should consider an independent 
200 adjudication process. The need for and details of specific monitoring may change as new data 
201 emerge.  Sponsors are encouraged to discuss their plans for specific safety monitoring with the 
202 FDA during the early stages of drug product development.  
203 204 The approach to the analyses of safety data should take into account the complexity of the study 
205 design (e.g., crossover by response or escape prov ision, or crossover by design).  In addition, the 
206 approach to the analyses of integrated safety data should take into account (possible) differing 
207 patient populations and/or differing study designs from multiple studies.

208 
209 D. Drug-Device Combination Product Considerations 
210 
211 Therapies developed for the treatment of RA include drug products that may require parenteral 
212 administration and the use of an accessory delivery unit (e.g., an autoinjector).  In these cases, 
213 the manufacturer of the drug product should ensure  that the accessory delivery unit is approved 
214 or cleared for marketing through the device regulatory process (e.g., 510(k) process or premarket 
215 approval) by the Center for Devices and Radiological Health.  If  the accessory delivery unit is 
216 not already approved or cl eared for marketing, then it should be approved or cleared at least 
217 concurrently with the drug product approval. 
218 219 When the characteristics of the drug product and the delivery device are such that they meet the 
220 definition of a combination product under 21 CFR 3.2(e), the center with primary jurisdiction for 
221 premarket review and regulation for the combination product will be determined based on the 
222 procedure set forth in 21 CFR 3.4. For exampl e, if the primary mode of action of the 
223 combination product is that of the drug product, th e entire combination product is assigned to the 
224 Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. For such combination products, we generally need 
225 only one marketing application (e.g., a new drug a pplication/biologics license application).  
226 Sponsors are encouraged to contact the Office of  Combination Products w ith general questions 
227 regarding drug product jurisdicti on and regulatory pathway for their drug-device combination 
228 products. 
229 230 Generally, each drug-device combination pr oduct should have a complete chemistry, 
231 manufacturing, and controls database; device design and development; and a substantially 
232 complete clinical development program to support  efficacy and safety of the entire combination 
233 product. We anticipate that the to-be-marketed  drug-device combination product will be used in 
234 the pivotal studies supporting the efficacy and safety of the combination product for marketing 
235 approval. For information on drug-device inject or development, see the draft guidance for 
236 237 industry and FDA staff Technical Considerations for Pen, Je t, and Related Injectors Intended for 
Use with Drugs and Biological Products . 
7  This guidance includes info rmation on issues such as 
238 root-cause analyses of device ma lfunction that may lead to potenti al improvements to the device 
239 240 itself. Likewise, current good manufacturing pract ice requirements for combination products are 
provided in 21 CFR part 4, subpart A.
8 
241 242 For the development of the RA drug delivery syst em, sponsors should take into consideration the 
243 characteristics of the intended user population and use environment.  For products intended for 
244 self-administration by an RA pa tient, the device should be durable , and the dexterity and visual 
245 acuity required to use the device s hould be within the capability of  RA patients.  Human factor 
246 studies to assess use-re lated hazards should be conducted early in development, ideally before 
247 the conduct of key dose-ranging, safety, and efficacy  studies.  For further considerations on 
7 When final, this guidance will represen t the FDA’s current thinking on this topic.  For the most recent version of a

250 
251 Ongoing evaluation of device performance should be incorporated into the pivotal studies for the 
252 combination product.  For example, the eval uation should include as king patients to report 
253 devices they perceive to be broken or malf unctioning and to return any such device for 
254 evaluation and identification of the problem.  De vice use and performance also can be evaluated 
255 through directed questions defined in the protocol s.  In addition, a small number of devices (e.g., 
256 100) that are apparently functioning normally s hould be collected after use and evaluated by in 
257 vitro performance testing to ensure device robustness.  
258 259 Although use of the to-be-marketed formulation and drug-device combination product 
260 throughout development is optimal, we acknowledge  that changes to the drug product delivery 
261 system may occur.  Changes in the formulation, excipients, or device components may affect the 
262 drug product delivery characterist ics and clinical performance of the drug-device combination 
263 product. The extent of clinical data needed to support such changes depends on the nature of the 
264 change and the development stage.  For example, a transition from a prefilled syringe to an 
265 autoinjector delivery system involves the followin g, at a minimum:  (1) hu man factor studies to 
266 evaluate potential use-re lated risks of the modified comb ination product; (2) a pharmacokinetic 
267 bridging study that demonstrates similar delivery of the drug product to th e same biospace across 
268 a range of body weights; and (3) real-life patient handling experience to assess device 
269 performance as discussed above.  Depending on the extent of the proposed changes, additional 
270 clinical data may be needed to support efficacy and safety, including immunogenicity. 
271 272 Sponsors are encouraged to discus s these types of issues and appr opriate marketing applications 
273 with the FDA as early in development as feasible.

8 Administration (FDA or Agency) on this topic.  It does not establish any rights for any person and is not 
9 binding on FDA or the public.  You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the 
10 applicable statutes and regulations. To  discuss an al ternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible

16 I. INTRODUCTION  
17  
18 The purpose of this guidance is to assist sponsors  in the clinical devel opment of drugs for the 
19 treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC) in adult and pediatric patients.2 Specifically, this guidance 
20 addresses the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA’s) current thinking regarding efficacy 
21 endpoints for UC clinical trials. This draft guida nce is intended to serve as a focus for continued 
22 discussions among the Division of Gastroenterology and Inborn Errors Products (DGIEP), 
23 pharmaceutical sponsors, the academic community, and the public.3    
24  
25 This guidance does not address the treatment or prevention of l ong-term complications of UC; 
26 for example, this guidance is not intended to disc uss endpoints for prevention or reduction in risk 
27 of colorectal cancer. 
28  
29 This guidance also does not cont ain discussion of the general issues of statistical analysis or 
30 clinical trial design. Those topics are addressed in th e ICH guidances for industry E9  Statistical 
31 Principles for Clinical Trials  and E10 Choice of Control Group and Related Issues in Clinical 
32 Trials , respectively.4    
33  
                                                 
1  This guidance has been prepared  by  the Division  of Gastroenterology  and Inborn  Errors Products in  the Center for 
Drug Evaluation and Research at the Food and Drug Administration.   
 
2 For the purposes of this guidance, all references to drugs  include both human  drugs and therapeutic biological 
products  unless otherwise specified.  
 
3 In addition to consulting  guidances, sponsors are encourag ed to contact the DGIEP to discuss specific issues that 
arise during the development of a given drug.  
 
4  We  update  guidances periodically.  To make sure you  have the most recent version of a guidance, check the FDA

5 A sign is defined as any objective visual or measured eviden ce of  a disease, or health  condition.   Signs, which  are 
observed or measured, are distinct from symptoms or clinical outcomes or treatment-related effect.  Signs are  
usually observed and interpreted by the clinician but may be noticed and reported by the patient.  A symptom  is 
defined as any subjective evidence of a disease or health co ndition  or treatment-related effect that can  be noticed and 
known only by the patient.  See the guidance for industry  Patient-Reported Outcome Measures:   Use in Medical  
Product Development to Support Labeling Claims  (patient-reported outcome guidance).  Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

34 In general, FDA’s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities.  
35 Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s curren t thinking on a topic and should be viewed only 
36 as recommendations, unless specif ic regulatory or stat utory requirements are cited.  The use of 
37 the word should in Agency guidances means that some thing is suggested or recommended, but 
38 not required.

41 II. BACKGROUND 
42 43 A. Ulcerative Colitis 
44 
45 UC is a chronic, relapsing disease characteri zed by diffuse mucosal in flammation of the colon 
46 (Langan, Gotsch, et al. 2007). The precise etio logy of UC is unknown; how ever, it is thought to 
47 be caused by an inappropriate inflammatory response to the gut contents in genetically 
48 predisposed individuals (Talle y, Abreu, et al. 2011; Abraham and Cho 2009).  The estimated 
49 U.S. incidence of UC is 9 to 12 cases per 100,00 0 persons per year, and the estimated prevalence 
50 is 205 to 240 cases per 100,000 pe rsons (Danese and Fiocchi 2011) .  There is considerable 
51 variability in incidence and pr evalence of UC around the world.  Approximately 20 percent of 
52 patients with UC present before age 20 (Kel sen and Baldassano 2008).  In the pediatric 
53 population (ages 0 to 17 years), the estimated U.S. incidence of UC is 3.2 cases per 100,000 
54 persons per year, and the estimated preval ence is 19.5 cases per 100,000 persons (Abramson, 
55 Durant, et al. 2010). 
56 57 UC involves the rectum and it may extend proximally in a contiguous pattern to affect part of the 
58 colon or the entire colon. C linical manifestations of active disease include bl oody diarrhea (with 
59 or without mucus), urgency, tenesmus, abdominal pain, weight lo ss, fever, and malaise.  In 
60 patients with extensive or severe inflammation, acu te complications such as severe bleeding and 
61 toxic megacolon, which can lead to perforation, may occur (Danese and Fiocchi 2011).  There is 
62 an increased risk of co lorectal cancer in UC pa tients compared to the general population; risk 
63 factors include long duration of disease, extensive colonic involvement, severe inflammation and 
64 epithelial dysplasia, a nd childhood-onset diseas e (Danese and Fiocchi 2011).  The signs and 
65 symptoms of UC in adults and children are similar;
5 however, abdominal pain, disease involving 
66 the entire colon, extra-intestinal  manifestations, proctitis (am ong girls), and disease severity 
67 necessitating colectomy are more common in children (Kelsen and Baldassano 2008; Malaty, 
68 Abraham, et al. 2013).

70 B. Treatment Goals 
71  
72 The short-term treatment goal of an active disease flare is to pr ovide relief to the patient by 
73 decreasing the severity of and achieving resolution of the signs and symptoms of active disease.  
74 After this has been achieved, the long-term tr eatment goal is to decr ease the frequency of 
75 subsequent disease flares. In both treatment phases (treatment of active disease flare and long-
76 term treatment), a related goal of treatment is to affect the disease process itself (by decreasing 
77 the mucosal inflammation of the colon). 
78  
79  
80 III. IDEAL PRIMARY EFFICAC Y ASSESSMENT TOOL  
81  
82 A test, tool , or instrument  is defined as “an assessment sy stem comprising three essential 
83 components:  1) materials for measurement; 2) an assay for obtaining the measurement; and 3) 
84 method and/or criteria for interpreting those measurements.”6  
85  
86 There are three clinical outcome assessment types relevant to the measurement of UC signs and 
87 symptoms:7  
88  
89 (1)  Patient-reported outcome:   A measurement based on a report that comes directly from  
90 the patient (i.e., study subject) about the status of a patien t’s health condition without 
91 amendment or interpretation of the patient’s  response by a clinicia n or anyone else.  A 
92 patient-reported outcome can be measured by self-report or by inte rview provided that 
93 the interviewer record s only the patient’s response.  Symptoms or other unobservable 
94 concepts known only to the patient can onl y be measured by patient-reported outcome 
95 measures.  Patient-reported outcomes can also assess the patient perspective on 
96 functioning or activities that ma y also be observable by others. 
97  
98 (2)  Observer-reported outcome:   A measurement based on a report of observable signs, 
99 events, or behaviors related to a patient’s  health condition by someone other than the 
100 patient or a health professional. Genera lly, observer-reported outcomes are reported by a 
101 parent, caregiver, or someone who observes the patient in daily life and are particularly 
102 useful for patients who cannot report for them selves (e.g., infants or individuals who are 
103 cognitively impaired). An  observer-reported outcome meas ure does not include medical 
104 judgment or interpretation.  
105  
106 (3)  Clinician-reported outcome:  A measurement based on a report that comes from a 
107 trained health care professiona l after observation of a patient ’s health condition.  Most 
108 clinician-reported outc ome measures involve a clinical j udgment or interpretation of the

109 observable signs, behaviors, or  other manifestations relate d to a disease or condition.  
110 Clinician-reported outcome m easures cannot directly assess symptoms that are known 
111 only to the patient. 
112 
113 FDA believes that the ideal primary efficacy assessm ent tool used in clin ical trials to support 
114 marketing approval for the treatment of UC  would consist of the following scales:8 
115 
116  A signs and symptoms assessment scale, be st measured by a patient-reported outcome 
117 instrument (or, in the case of young children (5 to 6 years old) or those unable to provide 
118 valid and reliable self-report,  an observer-reported outcome  instrument (Matza, Patrick, 
119 et al. 2013); and 
120 121  An endoscopic and histological assessment s cale, best measured by a clinician-reported 
122 outcome instrument.  A claim of “mucos al healing” would not be supported by 
123 endoscopy findings that provide only an assessment of the visual appearance of the 
124 mucosa; any claim related to findings on endoscopy, in the absence of a validated 
125 histological assessment of the mucosa, woul d be limited to the “endoscopic appearance 
126 of the mucosa.”   
127 
128 Sponsors are encouraged to develop such primary efficacy assessment tools.
9 
129 130 The intent of this dual measurement is to ensure that an observed improvement in signs and 
131 symptoms is related to an effect on underl ying inflammation, and vice versa.  Onset of 
132 achievement of the targeted improvement in these two components would not have to occur 
133 concurrently. One can lag behind the other; how ever, the improvement in whichever component 
134 occurs first must be sust ained through achievement of the remaining component.  
135 136 Ideally, a signs and symptoms assessment scale should consist of a well-defined and reliable 
137 patient-reported outcome instrument or observer- reported outcome instrument that measures the 
138 clinically important signs and symptoms of UC, including stool frequenc y and rectal bleeding.  
139 Identification of relevant signs and symptoms should be confirmed by qualitative research with 
140 patients and caregivers.  Instrument items should be clear and easily interpretable.  Additional 
141 tools, such as the Bristol Stool scale (Lew is and Heaton 1997), may be useful for visual 
142 evaluation of the diarrhea and can be incorporat ed into the signs and symptoms assessment for 
143 adults; the pediatric version of the Bristol Stool  scale should be considered for studies in 
144 children.  Qualitative research with patients a nd caregivers, as appropriate, also should be 
145 conducted to document understanding of the instrument, including its instructions, items, and 
8 Scale  is defined as the system of numbers or verbal anchors by which a value or score is derived for an item. 
Examples include visual analogue scal es, Likert scales, and numeric rating scales (see the patient-reported outcome 
guidance). 
9 Because instrument development can be time and resource  intensive, instrument developers, sponsors, and other 
interested parties should consider collaboration to develop publicly available clinical outcome assessments in a 
precompetitive manner using the process described in the guidance for industry and FDA staff Qualification Process 
for Drug Development Tools .

146 response options. Use of event logs and ite ms with a short recall period generally are 
147 recommended when signs and symptoms  of a condition vary frequently.   
148  
149 Although patient-reported outcome instruments should capture patient-reported signs and 
150 symptoms, an observer assessment of signs may be needed for children who are not able to 
151 reliably report thei r signs and symptoms (e.g., young children);10 sponsors can consider a 
152 separate age-appropriate instrume nt with a score that captures both patient reports of symptoms  
153 and observer reports of signs for use in children who cannot self-report on the full range of signs 
154 and symptoms.  Any assessment where an observer is asked to rate unobse rvable aspects of the 
155 child’s condition (e.g., abdominal pa in severity) should be avoided. Instead, observers should be 
156 asked to rate only signs and be haviors that are observable.  
157  
158 A well-defined and reliable clinician rating scale that measures the level of mucosal 
159 inflammation would be the ideal endoscopic and histological assessment tool.  Endoscopy should 
160 be used in conjunction with histology for an assessment of mucosal healing.  Endoscopy alone 
161 (without histology) only provides an  assessment of the visual app earance of the mucosa.  Ideally, 
162 clinicians performing the rating would have agreement on the definitions of the scale 
163 components, any procedures that are necessary when performing the rating (e.g., procedures for 
164 video recordings/equipment in the endoscopic assessment, and procedures for biopsy in the 
165 histological assessment), and any specific criteria to guide their judgments when selecting their 
166 response on the rating scale. 
167  
168 An instrument user manual is recommended fo r clinician-reported, patient-reported, and 
169 observer-reported outcome instruments to standa rdize instrument administration and provide any 
170 recommended procedures and definitions for use.   
171  
172  
173 IV. INTERIM APPROACHES TO  EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS  
174  
175 Until well-defined and reliable clinician-reported, patient-reported, and observer-reported 
176 outcome instruments become available for use in  clinical trials, spons ors should consider the 
177 strategies discussed in the follo wing sections when designing UC clinical trials.  Traditionally, 
178 the Mayo Score and Ulcerative Colitis Disease Activity Index (UCDAI) have been the most 
179 commonly used tools to support re gistration trials in UC (see Appendixes 1 and 2).  Both the 
180 Mayo Score and the UCDAI incorp orate scoring of stool frequency, rectal bleeding, endoscopic 
181 findings, and the physician’s asse ssment of disease activity. 
182  
183 The Mayo Score and UCDAI share limitations.  A key limitation of both the UCDAI and the 
184 Mayo Score is the physician’s a ssessment of disease activity and the Physician’s Global 
185 Assessment (PGA) subscores, respectively.11  A single general item cannot adequately capture 
                                                 
10 See Matza, Patrick, et al. 2013. 
 
11 The PGA is a clinician-reported a ssessment that reflects “the  patient’s recorded symptoms, the proctoscopic 
appearance of  the rectosigmoid  mucosa, an  d other pertinen t clinical indexes, such as physical findings and the 
patient’s performance status” (Schroeder, Tremaine, et al. 1987).

186 whether benefit is achieved in all, or only some, of the important signs and symptoms.  
187 Additionally, as previously discus sed, a signs and symptoms assessment scale is best measured 
188 by a patient-reported outcome instrument as opposed to a clinician-reported outcome instrument.  
189 Use of the PGA subscore/physician’s assessment of disease activity subscore or the full Mayo 
190 Score or the full UCDAI (which incorporate the PGA subscore/phys ician’s assessment of disease 
191 activity subscore) are not recommended as endpoint measures to support a marketing 
192 application. Although we acknowledge the limita tions of the Stool Frequency and Rectal 
193 Bleeding subscores in these tools,12,13 we recommend their use in addition to the Endoscopy 
194 subscore as endpoint measures for clinical trials until well-defined and reliable endpoint 
195 measures become available.    
196  
197 Data collection procedures for the assessment of the Rectal Bleeding, Stool Frequency, and 
198 Endoscopy subscores should be submitted for review and concurrence by the DGIEP.  The goal 
199 is to ensure that the following issues are addre ssed:  (1) the patient-repor ted assessments of stool 
200 frequency and rectal bleeding are standardized across pa tients; (2) the effect of inter-observer 
201 variability on the endoscopic a ssessment is minimized; and (3) the limitations from the PGA 
202 subscore is removed (see Table 1).  Strategies to improve the reliability  and precision of the 
203 components are discussed below.  The follo wing modifications reco mmended for the Mayo 
204 Score also should be ap plied to the UCDAI. 
205  
206 A. Stool Frequency and Rectal Bleeding Subscores 
207  
208 Patients should be provided standardized instru ctions for recording th e number of stools and 
209 their worst rectal bleeding over a 24-hour period; investigationa l sites should be provided 
210 instructions for calculation of the Stool Fr equency and Rectal Bleeding subscores.   
211  
212 1. Standardized Instructions for Recordi ng Number of Stools and Worst Rectal 
213 Bleeding  
214  
215 An example of standardized instructions (for the Mayo Score) is summarized in Table 1.  
216 However, we are open to considering alternative approaches as long as they are well-defined.14   
217 Standardized instructions should be drafted early in drug devel opment and shared with FDA for 
218 comment. 
219  
                                                 
12 The Stool Frequency subscore may not be  well-define d primarily because it relies on a  reference “normal” 
number of stools per day  (based on the number of stools when the patient  is not experiencing a flare) rather than the  
reported  absolute  number of stools per day.    
 
13 The Rectal Bleeding subscore may not be well-defined prim arily because it requires patients to report the answer 
to a double-barreled  question (it asks patients to choose streaks of blood  with stool less than  half the time versus 
obvious blood with stool most of the time) (Higgins 2012).    
 
14 Because instrument development can be time and resource  intensive, instrument developers, sponsors, and other 
interested  parties should consider collaboration to  develop  publicly available clinical outcome assessments in a 
precompetitive manner using  the process described in the guidance for industry and FDA staff Qualification Process 
for Drug Development Tools .

220 Table 1. Example of Standardized Instructio ns for Recording Number of Stools and Worst 
221 Rectal Bleeding (for the Mayo Sco re) (Each Over a 24-Hour Period)  
Category of Instructions Specific Instructions to Patients 
Definition of Stool  Patients should be instructed that a stool is defined as a trip to the toilet 
when the patient has either a bowel movement, or passes blood alone, blood and mucus, or mucus only 
Reference Remission Stool Frequency (over 24 
hours)  The patient should be asked to identify at the screening visit how many 
stools he or she had in a 24-hour period when in remission from UC 
 If the patient does not report that he or she has achieved remission, then 
the patient should be asked to identify the number of stools he or she had 
per day before initial onset of signs and symptoms of UC 
− Sponsors should record if the refe rence remission stool frequency is 
based on reported stool frequency when the patient was in remission or reported stool frequency befo re initial onset of signs and 
symptoms of UC.  
− Both the remission and pre-UC stool frequency should be collected at baseline. This allows exploration of the natural history of pre-diagnosis stool frequency versus  remission stool frequency. 
Most Severe Category of Rectal Bleeding (in a given 24-hour period)  Patients should be instructed to indicate the most severe category that describes the amount of blood they had in their stools for a given day 
 Categories of rectal bleeding should be defined as follows: 
‒No blood seen 
‒Streaks of blood with stool less than half the time 
‒Obvious blood (more than just streaks) or streaks of blood with stool 
most of the time 
‒Blood alone passed 
 Patients should be instructed to select “No Blood Seen” in the rectal bleeding section if they do not have stool during a given day 
Completion of Event Log 
or Diary*  Patients should be trained on the completion of the event log or diary 
 The instructions for completion of the stool frequency and rectal bleeding assessments should be incorporated into the event log or diary for ready reference by the patient 
Recording of Rectal Bleeding and Stool Frequency Assessments 
 Patients should be directed to capture their rectal bleeding and stool frequency assessments in event logs or daily diaries* for 1 week before each visit 
222 * Sponsors are encouraged to propose an electronic data collection method (e.g., voice response system, electronic 
223 diary, or Web-based system) as an alternative to pen and paper data collection. If an electronic data collection 
224 method is proposed, sponsors should provide instructions for training in electronic methods. 
225 
226 2. Calculation of Stool Frequency and Rectal Bleeding Subscores 
227 
228 Generally, sponsors have used an approach of ca pturing stool frequency a nd rectal bleeding data 
229 from the most recent 3-day consecutive period with in the week before the visit to calculate the 
230 Stool Frequency and Rectal Bleeding subscores. Either the average or the worst of the most 
231 recent 3-day consecutive period has been used fo r the calculation of the respective subscore.  
232 Missing data may be an issue if a consecutive 3- day period is not available (see section VII.A., 
233 Missing Data). Alternative proposals can be consid ered such as the collec tion of data from at 
234 least 3 days (including nonconsecu tive days) in the week before the visit.  Instructions to

235 investigators for calculation of St ool Frequency and Rectal Bleedi ng subscores should be drafted 
236 early in drug development and shared with FDA for comment. 
237 
238 B. Endoscopic Assessment 
239 
240 Endoscopic assessment should be documented by th e endoscopist performing the procedure, and 
241 ideally by blinded central readers reviewing video recordings of th e procedure.  Charters that 
242 standardize procedures, video recordings/equipment, and asse ssment of endoscopy should be 
243 drafted early in drug development and shared with FDA for comment. The protocol should 
244 specify how discrepancies between the assessment of  the endoscopist and th e central reader will 
245 be handled in the efficacy analys es.  Particularly important is  the interpretation and methodology 
246 underlying the scoring of endoscopic characteristics that may have subjective elements (e.g., 
247 friability).   
248 249 The Endoscopy subscore of the Mayo Score should  be modified so that a value of 1 does not 
250 include friability.  This is because the presence of friability (even if considered to be mild by the 
251 endoscopist/central reader) is not consistent with clinical remission  (the recommended definition 
252 of this endpoint includes a Ma yo Endoscopy subscore of 0 or 1)  (see section V.A., Clinical 
253 Remission and Clinical Response, and Appendix 1).  
254 
255 C. PGA Assessment/Physician’s Assessment of Disease Activity 
256 
257 The utility of the PGA subscore (in the full Ma yo Score)/Physician’s Assessment of Disease 
258 Activity subscore (in the full UCDAI) is questiona ble because the concept it purports to measure 
259 that is distinct from the other components is not clear.  Use of these subscores as part of the 
260 Mayo or UCDAI and the resulting full scores that  incorporate them are not recommended as an 
261 endpoint measure to support a marketing applicat ion.  Possible use of these or modified global 
262 scores as an exploratory endpoint (a physician’s globa l) could be considered. 
263 264 
265 V. EFFICACY ENDPOINT DEFINITIONS 
266 
267 This section focuses on endpoint definitions for phas e 3 clinical trials, and the associated claims 
268 that would be supported. 
269 270 Trial design issues such as the assessment  of disease severity (on entry) and the induction  and 
271 maintenance  paradigm (used in prior UC drug approvals),
15 and possible alternatives to this 
272 paradigm are beyond the scope of this guidance.  
273 
15 The paradigm of induction and maintenance trials has been used for prior UC drug approvals (i.e., induction trials 
are conducted to demonstrate efficacy after a short duratio n such as 1 to 3 months; and a maintenance trial is 
conducted to demonstrate durability of treatment effect over a longer period, such as 6 months or 1 year).

274 A. Clinical Remission and Clinical Response 
275 
276 Clinical remission (responder definition based on an abso lute total Mayo Score and absolute 
277 Mayo endoscopy, stool frequency, rectal  bleeding, and PGA subscores) and clinical response 
278 (responder definition based on a reduction in tota l Mayo Score and reduction in rectal bleeding 
279 subscore) have been accepted as primary endpoints in clinical trials th at have supported prior 
280 approvals of treatments of UC.16  We currently recommend a primary endpoint of clinical 
281 remission (responder definition based on Stool Frequency, Rectal Bleeding, and Endoscopy 
282 scores) (see section IV., Interim Approaches to  Efficacy Assessments).  Until a valid patient -
283 reported outcome instrument for UC signs and sy mptoms and a valid clinician rating scale for 
284 mucosal inflammation in UC become available,  a modified Mayo or modified UCDAI score 
285 omitting the physician’s global or disease activity rati ngs, as described in section IV, can be used 
286 as an endpoint measure.   
287 288 The following definition of clinical remission is recommended: 
289 
290  Stool Frequency subscore = 0 
291  Rectal Bleeding subscore = 0 
292  Endoscopy subscore = 0 or 1 (modified) on Mayo Score; or 0 on UCDAI 
293 
294 An alternative to a Stool Frequency subscore of 0 in the definition of c linical remission is the 
295 following: 
296 297 At least one point decrease in Stool Frequency subscore from Baseline (start of trial) to 
298 achieve a Stool Frequenc y subscore = 0 or 1 
299 300 Inclusion of a maximum score of 1 for the Stool Frequency subscore  in the definition of clinical 
301 remission would not support a labeling claim that  includes normalization of stool frequency. 
302 303 Sponsors should discuss their proposed endpoints for phase 3 trials at the end-of-phase 2 
304 meeting.  See also section VII., Statistical Considerat ions.  Sponsors should begin discussions of 
305 endpoint measures with FDA as early as possible during drug development. 
306 
307 B. Secondary Endpoints of Interest 
308 
309 Sponsors can propose to evaluate changes between the treatment arms of each of the subscores 
310 (Stool Frequency, Rectal Bleeding, and Endoscopy) and/or the total score (i.e., sum of the Stool 
311 Frequency, Rectal Bleeding, a nd Endoscopy subscores).   
312 
313 C. Assessment of Mucosal Healing vs. Endoscopic Appearance of the Mucosa 
314 
315 Mucosal healing (based on the Mayo Endoscopy subscore) has been included as a secondary 
316 endpoint in many clinical trials.  In many clinical trials, mucosal healing has been defined as 
16 See the Glossary of Historical Endpoints for the definitions of clinical remission  and clinical response .

Draft — Not for Implementation 
317 Mayo Endoscopic subscore of less than or equal to 1 point.  However, a claim of mucosal 
318 healing would not be supported through endosco py that provides only an assessment of the 
319 visual appearance of the mucosa. Any claim re lated to findings on endoscopy, in the absence of 
320 validated histological assessment of the mucosa, would be limited to th e endoscopic appearance 
321 of the mucosa.   
322 
323 There are currently limitations of histologic sc oring systems and of community standards for 
324 definitions of histologic improvement; thus, th ere are currently no criteria for histological 
325 assessment of mucosal healing.  Sponsors intending to pursue a cl aim of mucosal healing should 
326 discuss their proposed development plan with FDA.  Histologic evaluations of biopsy specimens, 
327 when obtained, should be conducted centrally. Ch arters that standardize biopsy and histology 
328 procedures and assessments (e.g., scoring for histology) should be dr afted early in drug 
329 development and shared with FDA for commen t.  Methods to address discrepancies in 
330 assessments between site and central readers shou ld be prespecified within the protocols.  
331 Grading scales and scoring techniques should be di scussed with FDA.  Use of measures that are 
332 not validated are unlikely to  support labeling claims.   
333 334 Sponsors should evaluate histological effects in phase 2 trials to inform how to effectively 
335 incorporate these assessments in phase 3 trials. 
336 
337 D. Corticosteroid-Free Remission 
338 
339 Corticosteroid-free remission  (often defined as clinical remission without concomitant 
340 corticosteroids at a particular time point in patients who were us ing corticosteroids at baseline) 
341 has been included as a secondary en dpoint in many clinical trials.
17 To ensure clinical 
342 meaningfulness of this endpoint, its definition should be based on a minimum duration of time 
343 over which a patient is consider ed to be both corticosteroid- free and in clinical remission; 
344 adequate justification shoul d be provided for the proposed minimum duration.   
345 346 
347 VI. TRIAL PROCEDURES AND TIMING OF ASSESSMENTS 
348 
349 At screening, it is important that all pa tients undergo endoscopy with biopsy to obtain 
350 histological confirmation of disease activity.  Sponsors shoul d propose a maximal time between 
351 conduct of the screening endoscopy and entry into the trial.  Sponsors seeking a claim of 
352 mucosal healing should discuss wi th FDA their proposal for histological assessments of biopsy 
353 specimens obtained during endoscopy at both the screening and end-of-treatment visits.  Table 2 
354 summarizes the key assessmen ts throughout the trial. 
355

363 histologic scoring systems and of community standards (for definiti ons of histologic improvement).
 
364 
365 The Stool Frequency, Rectal Bleeding, and Endos copy subscores of the Mayo score should be 
366 obtained at screening and end-of -treatment visits.  The Stool Frequency and Rectal Bleeding 
367 subscores of the Mayo Score should also be obta ined at on-treatment visits (see section V.B., 
368 Secondary Endpoints of Interest).    
369 370 Appropriate assays for pharmacokinetic and anti-drug antibody assessments should be used; 
371 there should be a prospective pl an for analyses of these data. 
372 373 Sponsors are encouraged to prospectively co llect data for non-endoscopic markers of 
374 inflammation (such as C-reactive protein level, fecal calprotectin and lactoferrin, or other 
375 putative biomarkers) throughout the trial; howev er, these markers may not support labeling 
376 claims.  Sponsors are encouraged to investigate the use of propos ed biomarker(s) for identifying 
377 patients with an increased like lihood of achieving clinical bene fit.  One approach is to 
378 characterize the biomarker(s) (i.e., to select the as say and cutoff values that are associated with 
379 clinical benefit) in early phase trials, and to validate the biomarker(s)  in the phase 3 trials; 
380 sponsors should discuss their proposed approach w ith FDA.  Sponsors are also encouraged to

384 
385 
386 VII. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
387 388 A. Missing Data 
389 
390 Sponsors should propose methods for handling missing data (e.g., one or more missing Mayo 
391 subscores). Different imputation methods should be consider ed before the study and the 
392 properties analyzed by simulation or other met hods, perhaps leading to a conclusion that the 
393 patient was a nonresponder in some cases or abse nt in others.  One possible method should be 
394 that if a patient is missing one or more Mayo su bscores at the visit wher e the primary endpoint is 
395 being assessed, the patient woul d be considered a treatment fa ilure, although this could also 
396 depend on the reason for discontinuation (see al so section IV.A.2., Calculation of Stool 
397 Frequency and Rectal Bleeding Subscores). 
398 399 Because there are a number of reasons why a patient may not have a protocol-mandated 
400 endoscopy performed, such assessments could intr oduce bias if there is nonrandomness of the 
401 missing data.  With regard to analyses of e ndoscopic findings, the prot ocol should prespecify 
402 how the following patients will be handled with  respect to defining endoscopy responders or 
403 nonresponders: patients who drop out,
19 are lost to follow-up, disc ontinue investigational drug, 
404 refuse endoscopy, or are otherwise deemed to be treatment failures.  If there are imbalances 
405 between study arms in the proportion of patients who meet such criteria , it is likely that the 
406 endoscopic data will be biased and may result in invalid estimates of treatment benefit.  
407 Although this is not likely to be a significant pr oblem in short-term trials, these concerns may 
408 limit the ability of trials  of longer duration to provide mean ingful endoscopic assessment data 
409 (see also section V.C., Assessment of Mucosa l Healing vs. Endoscopic Appearance of the 
410 Mucosa). 
411 
412 B. Primary Analysis 
413 
414 We recommend that analyses of binary respons es (e.g., clinical remission status) be based on a 
415 stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel  test of a difference in proportions.  The primary analysis 
416 should be adjusted by the stratifica tion factors used for randomization. 
417 
418 C. Secondary Analyses 
419 
420 Sponsors should calculate the chan ge from baseline in Stool Frequency, Rectal Bleeding, and 
421 Endoscopy subscores, and/or tota l score and compare these change s between the treatment arms 
422 (see section V.B., Secondar y Endpoints of Interest) as  secondary analyses.   
18 See the guidance for industry and Food and Drug Administration staff Requests for Feedback on Medical Device 
Submissions:  The Pre-Submission Program and Meetings with Food and Drug Administration Staff . 
19 The protocol should specify that patients who drop out of the trial will obtain an endoscopy upon exiting the trial.

425 VIII. PEDIATRIC DRUG DEVE LOPMENT CONS IDERATIONS 
426  
427 A. Addressing Pediatric Research Equity Act Requirements  
428  
429 To comply with the Pediat ric Research Equity Act (PREA) (21 U.S.C. 355c),20 a new drug 
430 application or biologics license application must contain data that are adequate to assess the 
431 safety and effectiveness of the drug for th e claimed indications to support dosing and 
432 administration in all relevant pediatric subpopulations unless th e requirement is waived or 
433 deferred. In addition, an age-appropriate form ulation must be developed for all relevant 
434 pediatric subpopulations. Sponsor s should begin discussions about  their pediatric formulation 
435 and clinical development plan early in developmen t because they are required to submit pediatric 
436 study plans no later than 60 days  after an end-of-phase 2 meeting.  We recommend sponsors 
437 refer to PREA as amended by the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act 
438 (FDASIA).21,22    
439  
440 The DGIEP has waived PREA requirements for pediatric studies of UC drugs in children 
441 younger than 2 years of age because studies would be impossible or highly impracticable in that 
442 age group. However, any request for waiver of studies in any specific pe diatric age groups (e.g., 
443 infants and young children) must include appropriate justification(s).23 Sponsors should consider 
444 enrollment of children of all ages affect ed by UC into pediat ric study(ies).    
445  
446 Pediatric studies should begin as soon as there ar e adequate data to suppo rt safety and expected 
447 benefit in pediatric patients w ith UC.  In some cases, a pediat ric subpopulation (e.g., adolescents) 
448 can be enrolled in phase 3 trials for adults provided nonclinical studies do not raise specific 
449 safety concerns for this  pediatric subpopulation.  
450  
451 All enrolled pediatric patients  should have a documented di agnosis of UC that includes 
452 confirmation by both endoscopic and histological assessments.  In addition, the presence of 
453 active inflammation at the time of entry into the clinical trial s hould be confirmed by 
454 visualization of the colon during the screeni ng period.  Sponsors should propose a maximal time 
455 between conduct of the screening endoscopy and entr y into the trial.   
                                                 
20 See section 505B(a)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (pediatric assessments “shall 
contain data, gathered  using appropriate formulations for each age group  for which the assessment is required that  
are adequate (i) to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug  or the biological product for the claimed  
indications in all relevant pediatric su bpopulation; and (ii) to support dosi ng and administration for each pediatric 
subpopulation for which the  drug or  the biological product is  safe and effective).”  
 
21 See PREA  (Public Law 108-155;  section 505B of the FD&C Act; 21  U.S.C. 355B) as amended by  FDASIA  
(Public Law  112-144).   
 
22 See the draft guidance for industry Pediatric Study Plans:  Content of  and Process for Submitting Initial Pediatric 
Study Plans and Amended Pediatric Study Plans . When final, this guidance will represent the FDA’s current 
thinking on this topic.

456 
457 B. Extrapolation of Efficacy 
458 
459 Based on sufficient similarities in the course of th e disease and the effects of the drug in adults 
460 and pediatric patients with UC, FDA has conclu ded that partial extrapolation of efficacy is 
461 acceptable from adequate and well-controlled studie s in adults for a systemically active drug if 
462 there are sufficient exposure-response data from adult and pediatric studies of that drug that 
463 support this approach, and the exposure-respons e relationships between  the populations are 
464 similar.24,25,26 It should be noted that because there is no established biomarker that can be relied 
465 upon to establish an exposure-response relations hip in UC, trials designed with endpoints 
466 directly measuring clinical be nefit (i.e., rectal bleeding, stoo l frequency, and endoscopy) should 
467 be used in pediatric studies to define the expos ure-response relationship.  It is important to 
468 adequately design the pediatric clinical trial to assess the dose- exposure-response relationship to 
469 ensure adequate dose selection in pediatrics.  In addition, pharmacokinetic and efficacy 
470 comparison of pediatrics to adults should be used to support pediatri c dose selection.  FDA 
471 encourages the use of modeling and simulation to design pediatric tr ials by leveraging 
472 knowledge from the adult clinical program.  Furthermore, the use of innovative model-based 
473 approaches is encouraged for analyzing the pediatric dose-ex posure-response data. 
474 
475 C. Data Collection in Pediatric Patients 
476 
477 Depending on the age of the pediatric patient, observer-based reporting (e.g., reporting from a 
478 parent or caregiver) may be needed for the as sessment of signs and symptoms.  Sponsors should 
479 discuss their proposal to addr ess age-specific data collection issues with FDA.   
480 
481 D. Other Pediatric Considerations 
482 
483 Growth parameter(s), including weight and he ight measured by a calibrated stadiometer 
484 (appropriate for patients 2 years of age and olde r), should be included as  secondary endpoint(s) 
485 in pediatric trials. 
486 
24 21 CFR 314.55 and 21 CFR 601.27 state:  “Where the course of the disease and the effects of the drug are 
sufficiently similar in adults and pediatric patients, FDA may conclude that pediatric effectiveness can be 
extrapolated from adequate and well-co ntrolled studies in adults usually supplemented with other information 
obtained in pediatric patients, such as pharmacokinetic studies.” 
25 See the Pediatric Study Decision Tree and discussion of extrapolation of efficacy in Dunne, Rodriguez, et al. 
2011.  
26 This topic was discussed in a Gastrointestinal Drugs Ad visory Committee meeting for an open label trial of a drug 
in pediatric patients that used the Mayo Score for its prim ary endpoint measure. See th e meeting materials available
