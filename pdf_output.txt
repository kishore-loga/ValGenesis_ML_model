This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) on 
this topic.  It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public.   You

I. INTRODUCTION  
 
This guidance is one in a series of guidance s that provide recommendations regarding eligibility 
criteria  for clinical trials of  drugs or biological products2 regulated by  CDER and CBER  for the 
treatment of cancer .3 Specifically, this guid ance includes recommendations regarding  the 
inclusion of patients with organ dysfunction  or with prior or concurrent malignancies . This 
guidance is intended to assist stakeholders , including  sponsors and institutional review boards , 
responsible for  the developm ent and oversight of clinical trials .  
 
A clinical trial’s eligibility criteria ( for inclusion and exclusion) are essential components of the 
trial, defining the characteristics of the study population. Because there is variability in 
investigational drugs  and trial objectives, eligibility criteria should be developed taking into 
consideration the mechanism of action of the drug, the targeted disease or patient population, the 
anticipated safety of the investigational drug, the availability of adequate safe ty data, and the 
ability to recruit trial participants from the patient population to meet the objectives of the 
clinical trial. However, some eligibility  criteria have become commonly accepted over ti me or 
used as  a template across trials without clear sc ientific or clinical rationale. Unnecessarily 
restrictive eligibility  criteria may slow patient accrual , limit  patient s’ access to clinical trials , and 
                                                 
1 This guidance has  been prepared by the Oncology Center of Excellence, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research 
(CDER), and Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) at the Food and Drug Administration.   
2 For the purposes  of this  guidance, references  to drugs  and drug and biological products include drugs approved 
under section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic  Act (21 U.S.C. 355) and biological products licensed 
under section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262) . 
3 Topics of the other three guidances are related to eligibility criteria for patients with human immunodeficiency 
virus, hepatitis B virus, or hepatitis C virus infections; for pat ients with brain metastases;  and regarding minimum 
age considerations for inclusion of pedi atric patients.

 2 lead to trial results that do not  fully  represent treatment effects in the patient population that will 
ultimately use the drug.4,5 
 
Broadening cancer  trial eligibility criteria can maximize the generalizability of trial results and 
the ability to understand the therapy’s benefit -risk profile a cross the patient population likely to 
use the drug in clinical practice and should be considered to avoid  jeopardizing patient safety.  
 
Trial design and methodological approaches are important considerations when enrolling a 
broader population and are ad dressed elsewhere6,7 and are not addressed in this guidance because 
the considerations are not specific to enrolling patients with organ dysfunction or prior or 
concurrent malignancies. 
 
In general, FDA’s guidance documents do not establish legally enforce able responsibilities. 
Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only 
as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of 
the word should  in Agency guidances means t hat something is suggested or recommended, but 
not required.  
 
 
II. BACKGROUND  
 
Patients with organ dysfunction are often excluded from clinical trials, regardless of knowledge 
of the metabolic pathways and excretory routes of the  investigational drug . The life-span of the 
general population is increasing  and thus includes increasing numbers of patients with co-morbid 
renal disease, cardiac disease, and hepatic dysfunction. Additionally, as life-span of the general 
population increas es, a greater number of  patients are anticipated to have  prior or concurrent 
malig nancies . By excluding individuals from cancer clinical trials  who have  major organ 
dysfunction  or previous or concurrent cancers , trial recruitment may favor younger patients , 
which may not be  fully  representative of the population for whom the drug will be indicated . 
Designing cancer clinical trials that include patients with organ dysfunction and prior or 
concurrent malignancies an d including this information in the labeling promotes the safe and 
effective use of these products across a broad er patient population likely to use the drug in 
clinical practice .

 3 III. RECOMMENDATIONS      
 
Thoughtful  consideration should be given to the potential inclusion of patients with organ 
dysfunction  or prior or concurrent malignancies in cancer clinical trials.  The following 
recommendations for eligibility criteria for  patients with  organ dysfunction in cancer  clinical 
trials focus on renal function, cardiac function, and hepatic function. This guidance also includes 
recommendations for eligibility criteria for patients with cancer who have prior or concurrent  
malignancies.   
 
A. Patients with organ dysfunction  
 
When pharmacokinetics (PK) and major routes of elimination in humans are not well 
understood, it is reasonable to enroll only patients with relatively preserved  organ function 
(primarily renal and hepatic) in  cancer clinical trials. As data on toxicity , including nonclinical 
and clinical toxicity , PK, and /or pharmacodynamics (PD) become available during drug 
development, protocols should be revised to include patients with compromised organ function 
where safe parameters  regarding dosage adjustments  have been  determined.8 
 
1. Renal function recommendations  
 
• Eligibility criteria should be based on a contemporary, widely accepted, and 
clinically applicable equation that estimates glomerular filtration rate or a 
measure of glomerular filtration rate  rather than an absolute serum creatinine 
concentration.  The equ ation use d for a particular patient population  should 
remain consistent throughout  the investigational drug development process.  
 
• Sponsors should provide adequate justification for the inclusion/exclusion of 
patients with various degrees of renal impairme nt based on the stage of 
product development, safety profile of the product , understanding of the effect 
of renal impairment on the elimination of the drug , and the safety of study 
procedures in patients with renal impairment.  
 
• Patients with renal impairment should be included in trials of investigational 
drugs when the available nonclinical and clinical data indicate that inclusion 
of patients with renal impairment would not place patients at unreasonable 
risk and/or adequate st eps can be taken to mitigate potential risks. When there 
is an expectation that the systemic exposure  will increase in patients  with 
renal dysfunction, inclusion of such patients  may be facilitated by prospective 
dose adjustment to produce similar systemic  exposures to those seen in 
patients with relatively preserved kidney function.9

 4 • Sponsors should address the need for and timing of studies to evaluate the 
effect of dialysis on drug clearance and the need for dosage adjustment for 
patients on dialysis.  
 
If there is adequate representation of patients with varying degrees of renal impairment, as well 
as data sufficient to adequately describe the impact of renal impairment on PK of the drug, 
population pharmacokinetic (popPK) analyses of data from phase 2 or  phase 3 clinical trials may 
be sufficient to characterize the impact of renal function.  
 
2. Cardiac function recommendations  
 
• Inclusion of patients with cardiovascular dysfunction may be possible when 
available nonclinical and clinical data, including PK and  PD data, indicate that 
inclusion of these patients does not expose them to  unreasonable risk . 
 
• Patients with significant clinical cardiac abnormalities (e.g., clinical heart 
failure, unstable angina) should be  excluded, especially in early -phase studies.  
 
• Inclusion criteria should require  investigator assessment of a potential 
participant’s risk for heart failure with a validated clinical classification 
system (e.g., the New York Heart Association Functional Classification).  
 
• Ejection fraction (E F) measurement : 
 
- EF measured by either echocardiography or multigated acquisition 
scan is acceptable for deter mining cardiac EF  for eligibility  criteria  
purposes .  
 
• QTc Prolongation :10 
 
- Sponsors should assess the effects of a drug on QTc during early 
clinical development.    
 
- Sponsors should determine whether a maximum QTc interval is 
necessary as a clinical trial eligibility criteri on based on whether there 
is a specific known risk of QTc prolongation, either through non -
clinical (e.g., hERG) or clinical trial data.  
 
 
 
                                                 
10 See the ICH guidance for industry E14 Clinical Evaluation of QT/QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic 
Potential for Non -Antiarrhythmic Drugs  (October 20 05) and the ICH guidance for industry E14 Clinical Evaluation 
of QT/QTc  Inter val Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential for Non -Antiarrhythmic Drugs – Questions and 
Answers (R3)  (June 2017) for additional information regarding QTc prolongation.   
 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations  
 
 5 3. Hepatic function recommendations  
 
Unlike other organ systems , liver biochemical testing does not provide sufficient  evidence of 
adequate liver drug metabolic function. While e stimates of hepatic function that incorporate 
clinical variables as well as functional and laboratory values, such as the Child -Pugh and Model  
for End -Stage Liver Disease scoring systems ,11,12 are adopted as markers of  hepatic metabolism  
in dedicated PK studies , hepatic metabolism may also be influenced by cancer and inflammation, 
even in the setting of normal scoring . To gauge  hepatic drug transf ormation capacity, pre -
existing liver disease, as well as epidemiological, genetic, environmental, and historical variables 
(e.g., chronic alcohol use and a past history of adverse drug reactions ) should be ascertained. 
Impaired hepatic blood flow, in part icular  when portal hypertension is ev ident, is critical to 
assessing how the liver metabolizes  drugs.  
 
• Inclusion of patients with severe hepatic impairment should be discussed with 
FDA.  
 
• Patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment13 (defined as the 
equivalent of National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (NCI CTC AE) grade 1 toxicity), as well as those with 
aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) elevations 
defined as grade 3 by the NCI CTCAE  (> 5 to 20 x ULN (upper limit of 
normal) ), may be asymptomatic and able to tolerate  doses equivalent to 
patients with normal hepatic function.  
 
• Inclusion of patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment may be 
appropriate when the available nonclinical and clinical data, including PK and 
PD data, indicate that inclusion of these patients  does not present  an 
unreasonable risk to patients . 
 
B. Patients with prior  or concurrent malignancy  
 
Patients with  prior  malignancies of the same or different tumor type and patients with concurrent  
malignanc ies of the same or different tumor type (referred to as  prior or conc urrent malignancies  
in this guidance)  whose natural history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with 
the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational drug should generally be eligible for 
enrollment in clinical trials . For example, in initial  dose finding or preliminary activity -estimating 
or proof -of-concept studies , patients with a history of prior  or concurrent  malignancies should not 
be excluded .

This draft guidance, when finalized, will represent the current thinking of the Food and Drug 7 
Administration (FDA or Agency) on this topic.  It does not establish any rights for any person and is not 8 
binding on FDA or the public.  You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the 9 
applicable statutes and regulations.  To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible 10 
for this guidance as listed on the title page.  11

 13  14 I. INTRODUCTION  15 
 16 The purpose of this guidance is to assist sponsors in the clinical development of investigational 17 
drugs for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB)  under section 505 of the Federal Food, 18 
Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 355 and FDA regulations at 21 CFR part 312 19 
and part 601.
2  Specifically, this guidance provides the FDA’s  current recommendations 20 
regarding the overall development program for a new investigational drug or drugs to be used in 21 
combination with approved drugs or as a new treatment regimen that includes one or more 22 
investigational drugs to support an indication for the treatment of pulmonary TB .  This guidance 23 
does not address the development of drugs for latent TB infection or for extrapulmonary TB. 24 
 25 Sponsors should also refer to the guidance for industry  Codevelopment of Two or More New 26 
Investigational Drugs for Use in Combination (June 2013) .
3  Sponsors are encouraged to discuss 27 
with FDA the programs and pathways facilitating drug development that m ight be applicable for 28 
their development program.4  29 
 30 This guidance revises and replaces the draft guidance for industry of the same name issued in 31 
November 2013.  This revision includes more detail regarding nonclinical models, early phase 32 
studies, and trial design considerations, including the demonstration of efficacy using superiority 33 
or noninferiority (NI) trial designs.  Additionally, updates are made regarding inclusion of 34 
pediatric subjects in trials, endpoint and safety considerations, and labeling.  The Appendix 35 
containing the NI margin justification has also been updated. 36

II. BACKGROUND  51 
 52 
Infections caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( M. tuberculosis ) are diagnosed  in the United 53 
States and are endemic  in many parts of the world.  Resistance to multiple drugs and coinfection 54 
with human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV)  pose challenges in the management of TB .  Drugs 55 
with new mechanisms of action,  impr oved safety profiles,  fewer drug- drug interactions, and 56 
treatment- shortening  combination  regimens are needed  to manage TB.   57 
 58 
 59 
III. DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM  60 
 61 
A. General Considerations 62 
 63 
1. Early Phase Clinical Development Considerations  64 
 65 
Nonclinical evaluations provide  valuable information for the development of investigational 66 
drugs  (see section III.C.1., Microbiology Considerations , section III.C.2.,  Relevant Nonclinical 67 
Safety Considerations , and section III.C.3., PK/PD  Considerations ).  68 
 69 
Activity of antimycobacterial drug s can be evaluated in trials of early bactericidal activity  (EBA)  70 
and/or in phase 2 trials that evaluate microbiologic al outcomes at early t ime points.   For a 71 
combination regimen , the sponsor should evaluate t he contribution of each drug to the treatment 72 
effect .5 This can be evaluated in phase 2 clinical development and in nonclinical studies (see 73 
section III.C.1., Microbiology Considerations ).  Treatment of pulmonary TB includes more than 74 
one drug in a treatment regimen, and sponsors may be developing more than one investigational 75 
drug as part of a new combination regimen .  Sponsors should consult with the Agency early in 76 
development regarding plans to demonstrate the contribution of the investigational drug(s) as 77 
part of a combination regimen.  78 
 79 
 
5 The recommendations in this guidance are relevant to demonstrating the contribution of the individual new 
investigational drugs to the effect(s) of the combination  regimen  and are consistent with the requirements of 21 CFR 
300.50, Fixed-combination prescriptio n drugs for humans.  Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 
Draft — Not for Implementation 
3 a. EBA  80 
 81 
If applicable to the investigational drug under study, EBA trials evaluating the quantitative 82 
counts of viable M.  tuberculosis  from daily collections of sputum can provide information on the 83 
bactericidal activity of antimycobacterial drugs .  These trials are intended to evaluate 84 
antimycobacterial activity  of investigational drugs alone or in combination  over a brief time 85 
course (e.g., 7 to 14 days).  EBA trials can provide preliminary evidence for the contribution of 86 
each drug to the treatment effect of the combination regi men.  Appropriate subjects for 87 
enrollment in  EBA trials include immunocompetent subjects , treatment- naïve adul t subject s at 88 
low risk of infect ion with drug- resistant TB, and subjects with no evidence of extra -pulmonary 89 
disease, who can begin standard- of-care treatment for pulmonary TB at the completion of the 90 
EBA trial.   91 
 92 
b. Phase 2 evaluations 93 
 94 Sponsors should conduct phase 2 trials to assess the antimycobacterial activity of a n 95 
investigational drug regimen .  In addition, if feasible , a phase 2 development program should 96 
include a dose ranging study or studies to assist in determining the most appropriate dose 97 
regimen to be taken into phase 3.  Phase 2 exploratory endpoints can include, but are not limited 98 
to, the following: (1) 8- week evaluation for  absence of acid -fast bacilli (AFB) in sputum; (2) 99 
time to sputum culture negativity for M.  tuberculosis; (3) symptom improvement; and/or (4) a 100 
biomarker intended to predict clinical benefit.  The Agency recommend s that as part of phase 2 101 
trial designs, sponsors include long- term follow -up with collection of clinical endpoints in 102 
addition to earlier time  points. 103 
 104 
2. Efficacy Considerations 105 
 106 An investigational drug can be evaluated for efficacy when added to combination re gimens of 107 
already  approved drugs.  Additionally, an entirely new combination regimen comprised of 108 
investigational drugs can be evaluated for efficacy.  A single adequate and well -controlled trial 109 
in subjects with pulmonary TB , support ed by other confirmatory evidence (e.g., evidence of 110 
antimycobacterial activity from nonclinical data, EBA, and p hase 2 trials), may  provide  evidence 111 
of effectiveness when the single trial demonstrate s a clinically meaningful and statistically robust 112 
treatment effect.
6  See section III., B., Specific Efficacy Trial Consideration, below for further 113 
discussion regarding efficacy considerations.  114 
 115 
3. Safety Considerations 116 
 117 The evaluation of the safety profile of an investigational drug can be challenging because 118 
patients with pulmonary TB  often have comorbid conditions.  Sponsors should evaluate potential 119 
drug- drug interactions that may occur during c oadministration with other antimycobacterial 120 
drugs or other concom itant medications  (e.g., antiretroviral drugs).   121 
 
6 See the draft guidance for industry Demonstrating  Substantial Evidence of Effectiveness for Human Drug and 
Biological Products  (December 2019).  When final, this guidance will represent the FDA’s current thinking on this 
topic.  For t he most recent version of a guidance, check the FDA guidance web page at

4  122 
Hepatotoxicity and QT interval prolongation are common adverse reactions with 123 
antimycobacterial drugs.  Sponsors should evaluate i nvestigat ional drugs for their potential to 124 
cause hepatotoxicity, QT prolongation, and arrhythm ias.7, 8  125 
 126 
Sponsors should discuss the  size of the preapproval safety database with the FDA during drug 127 
development.  For assessment of risks and benefits in subjects with an unmet medical need, a 128 
smaller safety database of approximately 300 subjects treated at (or greater/longer than) the 129 
proposed intended dose and duration may be sufficient . If safety signals are identi fied, a larger 130 
safety database may be needed.  131 
 132 
B. Specific Efficacy Trial Considerations 133 
 134 
1. Trial  Design s 135 
 136 
Sponsors can use t he following trial designs to demonstrate  superiority :  137 
 138 
• A regimen that includes one or more investigational drugs is compared to a standard 139 
regimen, with efficacy demonstrated by showing superiority of the investigational drug 140 
regimen over the standard regimen.9   141 
 142 
• The investigational drug (s) plus the optimized background regimen (OBR)  is compared 143 
to the matching placebo plus the OBR, with e fficacy demonstrated by showing 144 
superiority of the investigational  drug  regimen  over the placebo -containing regimen.  145 
Optimized  background antimycobacterial treatment  should be based on epidemiologic 146 
information and in vitro  susceptibility testing , when available.   147 
 148 
Sponsors can use t he following trial designs to demonstrate NI:  149 
 150 
• An investigational drug regimen is compared to a standard regimen.  NI  would be 151 
demonstrated by showing that the investigational regimen performs within a prespecified 152 
margin of the performance of the standard regimen.  153 
 154 
• The investigational drug replaces one of the drugs  in a st andard combination regimen .  155 
The investigational drug regimen should perform within an acceptable NI  margin that is  156 
based on the known quantitative and reliable contribution of the drug that has been 157

5 replaced  to the standard regimen.  This NI trial design determines the efficacy 158 
contribution of the investigational drug to the regimen.  159 
 160 
Interpretation of the results of an NI trial relies on a justified NI margin.  This margin , which is 161 
highly dependent on the specific design of the NI  trial, including the control regimen , is based , in 162 
part, on data f rom previously conducted trials  to evaluate for  historical e vidence of s ensitivity to 163 
drug e ffects  (HESDE) and estimate the effect of the active control .10  The Appendix contains  an 164 
example of a n NI margin justification for a trial of a 4-month regimen for drug- susceptible TB .   165 
 166 
The FDA has not estimated  an exact numerical treatment effect for the standard regimen of 2 167 
months of treatment with ethambutol, isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide followed by 4 168 
months of treatment with isoniazid and rifampin (abbreviated terminology : 2EHRZ/4HR)  for 169 
patients wi th drug- susceptible pulmonary TB .  However, considering the historical data on 170 
management and outcomes of patients with pulmonary TB in the era before antibacterial drug 171 
therapy and the highly successful results following treatment with 2EHRZ/4HR, there is  support 172 
for the selection of an NI margin based on the large degree of clinical benefit .  For example, 173 
given that  the success rates of 2EHRZ/4HR exceed 90 percent , the numerical treatment effect is 174 
likely to far exceed 10 percent  (Nahid et al . 2016 ).  The refore, based on clinical judgement, a 1 0 175 
percent  NI margin is clinically relevant  and has appropriate preservation of the treatment effect  176 
for an NI trial to determine the efficacy of a n investigational drug regimen as a whole based on 177 
comparison to this 6-month standard regimen .  178 
 179 
Depending on the new investigational drug regimen, study design of the NI trial, potential impact 180 
(e.g., ability to fulfill  an unmet medical need ), and safety profile of the regimen, it may be 181 
appropriate to set a wider NI  margin  and still plan for a trial design that is feasible and provides a 182 
reasonable preapproval safety database.  The Agency en courages s ponsors to  discuss their 183 
clinical trial designs and NI margin justification s with the FDA.11 184 
 185 
For both superiority trials and NI  trials that assess the activity of the investigational drug regimen 186 
as a whole, the sponsor will also need to address the added contribution of the components of the 187 
regimen .9  This  may be accomplished through nonclinical trials, EBA studies, phase 2 trials 188 
and/or as part of the pivotal efficacy trials.  189 
 190 
2. Trial  Populati on 191 
 192 
The trial population should include adult  subjects and if appropriate , pediatric subjects with 193 
pulmonary TB.  The presence of extrapulmonary disease may require longer durations of 194 
treatment than pulmonary TB and assessment of endpoints that evaluate t he extrapulmonary 195 
site(s).  Trials can include subjects with either drug- susceptible or drug -resistant pulmonary TB 196 
depending on the anticipated effectiveness of the antimycobacterial drugs being evaluated.  197 
 198 
 
10 See ICH E10 for a discussion of HESDE.  
 
11 See also the article Four -Month Moxifloxacin- Based Regimens for Drug -Sensitive Tuberculosis  (Gillespie et al. 
2014) . Contains Nonbinding Recommendations  
Draft —  Not for Implementation  
6 Protocols should specify how subjects will be handled after  in vitro  susceptibility results are 199 
available, both in the conduct of the trial  and in the analysis of the  results.  200 
 201 
Enrichment strategies regarding trials for  drug -resistant TB  can include a focus on contacts of 202 
subjects with drug- resistant TB , subjects from areas with a high prevalen ce of drug resistance, 203 
subjects who  relaps e after previous treatment, and subjects with disease progression on a 204 
standard regimen.   205 
 206 
3. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  207 
 208 
The FDA r ecommend s the following inclusion criteria for subjects with pulmonary TB : 209 
 210 
• Presence of AFB in  a sputum specimen detected by smear microscopy or other  rapid 211 
diagnostic test .  Microbiological diagnosis of TB  should be confirmed by culture from at 212 
least one sputum sample obtained at the time of enrollment.  213 
 214 
• Chest radiograph ic findings consistent with active pulmonary TB , for example , cavitary 215 
lesions, apical or other infiltrates, or hilar lymphadenopathy.  216 
 217 
• A minimum of two of the following signs or symptoms that have been present for at least 218 
2 weeks:  219 
 220 
 Sputum production  221 
 222 
 Cough 223 
 224 
 One or more episodes of hemoptysis  225 
 226 
 Fever (e.g., oral temperature greater than or equal to 38.0 degrees Celsius on at least 227 
two occasions)  228 
 229 
 Pleuritic chest pain  230 
 231 
 Weight loss  232 
 233 
 Night sweats 234 
 235 
Use of rapid diagnostic or nonculture tests may help identify a subject for enrollment in a  TB 236 
trial.  If the tests being  used are not FDA cleared, sponsors should provide sufficient information 237 
about the performance characteristics of the tests determined from analytical validation studies.  238 
 239 
The FDA r ecommend s the following  as exclusion criteria  for subjects  with pulmonary TB : 240 
 241 
• One or more weeks  of therapy for the current episode of active TB  (unless being enrolled 242 
in a trial targeting drug- resistant TB  and there is documented lack of response to therapy 243 
based on clinical and microbiological findings)  244 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations  
Draft —  Not for Implementation  
7  245 
• Signif icant concurrent illness other than HIV (e.g., lung cancer ) that may affect outcome 246 
assessment  247 
 248 
• Unwilling ness to comply with recommendations from local public health authorities for 249 
the management of patients with pulmonary TB  250 
 251 
4. Randomization, Stratification, and Blinding  252 
 253 
Trials should be randomized and double -blind  unless a sponsor can provide a scientifically 254 
adequate explanation why blinding cannot be accomplished.  If trials are single  blind or open 255 
label, sponsors should discuss potential biases with the FDA and how these biases will be 256 
addressed.   If the trial cannot be fully blinded, the sponsor should maintain the maximum 257 
possible level of blinding with in the trial with blinded assessors, blinded databases until database 258 
lock, etc.  259 
 260 
Sponsors should consider s tratification of subjects  based on certain baseline characteristics (e.g., 261 
by the presence or absence of cavitary disease, HIV infection ).  The sponsor should include in 262 
the protocol a discussion of how the analyses will account for the stratified randomization.12 263 
 264 
5. Specific  Populations  265 
 266 
a. Pediatric populations  267 
 268 
The FDA encourages sponsors to begin discussions about their pediatric clinical development 269 
plans as early as is feasible.  The additional safeguards of 21 CFR part 50, subpart D, for 270 
enrolling children in cl inical investigations, affect the timing and design of trials that support 271 
pediatric drug development.  In accordance with these requirements, sponsors can enroll 272 
pediatric subjects in trials if sufficient safety , antimycobacterial activity , pharmacokineti c (PK) , 273 
and efficacy  data in adult  subject s are available and appropriate dosing regimens  for pediatric 274 
subjects  have been characterized.13  Sponsors can include a dolescent  subject s with pulmonary 275 
TB in phase 3 clinical trials, if appropriate.14 276 
 277 
Sponsors must  submit pediatric study plans  no later than 60 calendar days after the date of the 278 
end-of-phase 2 meeting  or an other time as agreed upon by the FDA and the sponsor  unless the 279

8 investigational drug has been  granted  an orphan designation.15  Pedi atric formulation 280 
development should begin as soon as results from the adult phase 2b trials are known and the 281 
sponsor has determined an appropriate dosing regimen.  282 
 283 
Extrapolation of adult efficacy for the treatment of pulmonary TB to pediatric populations is 284 
acceptable for most pediatric populations, with the exception of  very young children, who have 285 
different clinical and pathophysiologic characteristics.  Sponsors should provide PK and safety 286 
information in a sufficient number of pediatric subjects to support the appropriate dose for 287 
treatment of children with pulmonary TB.  Cohorts for pediatric studies can be defined based on 288 
chronological age or weight- based criteria, particularly for oral drugs.  Studies of drugs across 289 
the pediatric spectrum of ages/weights can be conducted in parallel rather than sequentially 290 
unless there are specific safety or PK properties that warrant a different approach.   If existi ng 291 
animal studies have identified potential developmental concerns for target organs (toxicology or 292 
pharmacology), juvenile animal toxicity testing may be appropriate .16, 17 293 
 294 Pediatric development plans for new TB investigational drugs could include children living with 295 
HIV provided there are no safety or drug -drug interaction issues  that cannot be managed .  296 
 297 Sponsors should discuss their  pediatric development programs with the FDA,  especially if they 298 
include very young children (e.g., those younger than 5 years of age) because of  differences in 299 
clinical manifestations (e.g., increased likelihood of extrapulmonary disease) and 300 
pathophysiologic characteristics.  301 
 302 
b. Pregnant females 303 
 304 
Sponsors can include pregnant females in clinical trials once all female reproduction toxicity 305 
studies and the standard battery of genotoxicity tests have been conducted.
18  Infants born to 306 
female subjects  who received the investigational drug(s) should be followed by investigators for 307 
an appropriate length  of time; sponsors should discuss the duration with the FDA before trial 308 
conduct.19   309 
 
15 See section 505B (e)(2)(A)  of the FD&C Act  (21 U.S.C. 355 c(e)(2)(A)).  For additional information, see the 
guidance for industry Pediatric Study Plans: Content of and Process for Submitting Initial Pediatric Study Plans

17 We support the principles of the 3Rs (reduce, refine, and replace) for animal use in testing when feasible.  We 
encourage sponsors to consult with the review division  when considering  using  a nonanimal testing method they 
believe is su itable, adequate, validated, and feasible.  We will consider if such an alternative method could be 
assessed for equivalency to an animal test method.

9  310 
c. Other spe cific populations  311 
 312 
Sponsors should include in trials geriatric  subjects,20 subjects with renal insufficiency, diabetes 313 
mellitus, and subjects  with hepatic impairment, if feasible .  Because of the high incidence of TB  314 
in patients coinfected with HIV, subjects with HIV should be included in trials .   315 
 316 
6. Dose Selection  317 
 318 
When selecting a dosing regimen to be evaluated in phase 3 clinical trials, sponsors should 319 
consider target PK/pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters (e.g., area under the curve/minimum 320 
inhibitory concentration (MIC), maximal concentration /MIC, time above the MIC) based on 321 
in vitro models  (see s ection III. C.1.a ., In vitro studies ) and animal models  of TB , results from 322 
early clinical trials (e.g., EBA and/or trials of AFB clearance from sputum at early time points), 323 
and results from exposure -response evaluations .  PK/PD evaluations should include evaluations 324 
based on free drug concentrations . 325 
 326 
7. Choice of Comparators  327 
 328 
The choice of comparator or background regimen depends in part on the subject population that 329 
the sponsor will enroll in the trial (e.g., the likelihood of infection with drug- susceptible or drug - 330 
resistant M.  tuberculosis ).  In ge neral, sponsors should choose comparator regimens that contain 331 
FDA- approved drugs and repr esent standard  of care.   Before trial initiation, s ponsors should 332 
discuss with the FDA t he use of comparator regimens based on local practice outside of the 333 
United St ates, or the use of drugs that are not FDA -approved.  334 
 335 
8. Efficacy Endpoints  336 
 337 
Sponsors can use t he following efficacy endpoints in clinical trials of investigational drugs 338 
intended to treat pulmonary TB : 339 
 340 
• A primary clinical efficacy endpoint that is comprised of survival and evaluation of 341 
M. tuberculosis growth on serial sputum culture examinations at a fixed time  point 342 
following randomization for all treatment arms and includes  a period of follow -up 343 
after completion of the planned treatment period.   The FDA defines c linical success 344 
and failure as follows:  345 
 346 
Clinical success is assigned to subjects who are alive, achieved M. tuberculosis  culture 347 
negativity on serial sputum examinations, did not experience relapse or recurrence of 348 
pulmonary TB, and otherwise did not meet a definition of clinical failure.  In general, 349 
 
20 See the ICH guidances for industry E7 Studies in Support of Special Populations:  Geriatrics  (August 1994) and 
E7 Studies in Support of Special Populations:  Geriatrics :  Questions and Answers  (February 2012) . Contains Nonbinding Recommendations  
Draft —  Not for Implementation  
10 protocol -defined serial sputum examinations should occur every 2 weeks or once a month 350 
during treatment, and every 3 months following completion of treatment.21 351 
 352 
Clinical failure  is defined as having one or more of the following:  353 
 354 
 Protocol -defined clinical progression of pulmonary disease during treatment  355 
 356 
 Switch in antimycobacterial therapy because of  tolerability issues or clinical 357 
progression of pulmonary TB  358 
 359 
 Signs or symptoms of active TB, including radiographic worsening compared to 360 
baseline findings, resulting in reinitiation of antimycobacterial thera py during 361 
follow -up22 362 
 363 
 Death during treatment or follow -up 364 
 365 
 Growth of M.  tuberculosis on sputum culture outlined as follows : 366 
 367 
 Failure to achieve M. tuberculosis  culture  negativity in serial sputum specimens 368 
during the treatment period 369 
 370 
 Failure to maintain culture negative status a fter a specific time point defined in 371 
the trial (in general, this is expected to be any time after two consecutive negative  372 
sputum cultures, taken at least 28 days apart) on therapy or in follow -up 373 
 374 
 Any growth of M.  tuberculosis  from an extrapulmonary site during the trial  375 
 376 
• A surrogate  endpoint based on results of  M. tuberculosis sputum cultures during 377 
treatment .  Demonstration of treatment effect on sputum culture conversion from 378 
positive to negative  during treatment, either as a time -to-conversion analysis or at a fixed 379 
time point (e.g., at 2 months from randomization), could be considered as surrogate 380 
endpoints reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit under the accelerated approval 381 
statutory an d regulatory provisions .23  Additional considerations related to accelerated 382 
approval regarding verification and description of  clinical benefit , including the 383 
durability of the treatment effect are discussed in section III.B.11., Accelerated Approval 384 
Considerations .  Sponsors should obtain s erial cultures at specific time points during 385 
treatment (e.g., every 2 weeks or every month).  The time to sputum culture conversion is 386 
the time to the first sterile culture , verified by M. tuberculosis  culture negativity in at 387 
 
21 The protocol -defin ed timing of serial examinations of sputum for culture may differ from clinical practice, which 
often depends on local treatment guidelines and respiratory isolation procedures.   
 
22 In some circumstances , antimycobacterial therapy may be restarted though there is diagnostic uncertainty whether 
relapse has occurred, but therapy is subsequently stopped when an alternative diagnosis is established.  Protocols 
should define the duration of retreatment therapy that will be used to define clinical failure to avoid labeling all trial 
subjects  in this situation as failures.

11 least two subsequent consecutive sputum specimens taken at least 14 days apart  (e.g., 388 
three consecutive negative sputum culture s).  Sputum cultures can be evaluated on either 389 
solid or liquid media  (see section III.B.11., Accelerated Approval Considerations) .  390 
 391 
• Secondary  and exploratory endpoint s.  Sponsors should consider  the following : 392 
 393 
 A well -defined and reliable evaluation of symptoms , which can be included in the 394 
clinical  trial as a secondary or exploratory endpoint.  O f note, symptom evaluation in 395 
certain  patient populations may be more difficult to  interpret , for example, among 396 
patients  coinfected with HIV who experience immune reconstitution inflammatory 397 
syndrome  or non- HIV- infected individuals with paradoxical reactions (Rangaka et al . 398 
2012).  399 
 400 
 Molecular or other biochemical evaluations to ascertain whether a positive culture for 401 
M. tuberculosis after drug treatment represents relapse or reinfection (e.g. , an 402 
exploratory endpoint analysis that treat s relapse of the baseline M. tuberculosis  403 
infection as a failure  of the  original study treatment and treats reinfection with a new 404 
M. tuberculosis  isolate as a  success of the original study treatment ). 405 
 406 
9. Trial  Procedur es and Timing of Assessments  407 
 408 
a. Entry visit  409 
 410 
Sponsors should obtain baseline demographic information, current medications, and complete 411 
physical e xamination s at the entry visit.  In addition, sponsors should obtain the following at 412 
entry:  413 
 414 
• Clinical signs and symptoms of pulmonary TB  (e.g., cough, sputum production, episodes 415 
of hemoptysis, fever, pleuritic chest pain, weight loss, night sweats) . 416 
 417 
• Baseline safety laboratory evaluations . 418 
 419 
• HIV serology and, if HIV positive, viral load and  CD4 cell count . 420 
 421 
• Imaging results (standard posterior to anterior view and lateral chest radiographs or 422 
comput ed tomography scans ) describing the extent and severity of pulmonary disease . 423 
 424 
• Sputum specimens for AFB smears and mycobacterial culture obtained by one of the 425 
following: spontaneous expectoration, i nduction with hypertonic saline , bronchoscopy , or 426 
gastric lavage (e.g., for pediatric subjects).  When applicable, baseline specimens for 427 
quantitative cultures should be collected in a standardized manner (e.g., single early 428 
morning induced sputum , pooled 24- hour sputum) . 429 
 430 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations  
Draft —  Not for Implementation  
12 b. Visits during  therapy and after therapy completion 431 
 432 
In general, clinical assessments should occur weekly or biweekly during the first months of 433 
therapy, followed by monthly assessments until therapy completion.  After completion of 434 
therapy, assessments should occur approximately every 3 months until the assessment of the 435 
primary efficacy endpoint is complete (e.g., at 12 months  after randomization).  Ass essments of 436 
signs and symptoms, adverse effects, and laboratory tests, as appropriate, should occur at these 437 
visits.  In addition, targeted physical examinations should be performed.   438 
 439 
During therapy, sponsors should obtain s putum specimens for AFB smears and culture at least 440 
monthly.  Depending on the investigational drug regimen and design, a shorter interval between 441 
specimen collections (e.g., 2 weeks) may be appropriate for certain periods of the trial.   442 
 443 
If subjects are not able to expectorate sputum spontaneously at follow -up visits  after therapy 444 
completion , sponsors should consider other methods to obtain sputum  (e.g., sputum induction ). 445 
 446 
10. Statistical Considerations  447 
 448 
In general, the sponsor should include in the protocol  a detailed statistic al analysis plan stating 449 
the trial hypotheses and the efficacy analysis methods.   450 
 451 
Sponsors should consider t he following definitions of analysis populations:  452 
 453 
• Safety population:   all subjects who received at least one dose of the investigational 454 
drug during the trial . 455 
 456 
• Intent -to-treat (ITT)  population :  all randomized subjects . 457 
 458 
• Microbiological ITT (m icro-ITT)  population:   all randomized subjects  with a positive 459 
culture for M. tuberculosis from a pretreatment  prerandomization  sample.  For trials 460 
intended  to focus on subjects with drug- resistant TB, sponsors can  choose for the primary 461 
analysis  a micro -ITT population of all randomized subjects  with a  positive culture for  a 462 
drug- resistant isolate of M. tuberculosis in the  pretreatment prerandomization  sample.  463 
 464 
• Per-protocol  population:   all randomized subjects  with a positive culture from a 465 
pretreatment sample who achieve a prespecified level of compliance with the protocol 466 
(e.g., presence at all or a high percentage of follow -up visits ). 467 
 468 
In general, the analysis population of greatest interest in the determination of efficacy is the 469 
micro -ITT population.  In addition, sponsors should evaluate consistency of results for efficacy 470 
in the ITT and per -protocol populations.  If there are notable differences between outcomes for 471 
the ITT and per-protocol populations, the sponsor should investigate reasons for these 472 
differences.    473 
 474 
All subjects should be followed completely for the duration of the trial even if they discontinue 475 
the investigational drug (s).  Sponsors should make every effort to minimize the loss to follow -up 476 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations  
Draft —  Not for Implementation  
13 throughout the trial .  Given that missing data are nonetheless likely to occur, the protocol should 477 
state how missing data will be handled in the primary efficacy analysis.  Additional ly, the 478 
statistical analysis plan should define additional methods for handling missing data.  The study 479 
report should include a n assessment of t he dependence of the trial results on the specific method 480 
for handling missing data. 481 
 482 
To improve the precision of treatment effect estimation and inference, sponsors should consider 483 
adjusting for prespecified baseline factors that are anticipated to be pro gnostic of the outcome.  If 484 
randomization is stratified by baseline covariates, the analysis should account for the stratified 485 
randomization. 486 
 487 
11. Accelerated Approval Considerations  488 
 489 
In some circumstances, approval under 21 CFR part 314, subpart H , or 21 CFR part 601, subpart 490 
E, may be applicable to drugs developed for the treatment of TB that provide clinically 491 
meaningful benefit over existing treatments.   An endpoint based on conversion of sequential 492 
M. tuberculosis sputum cultures to negative  (e.g., percent conversion at a prespecified time 493 
point) can be used as a surrogate endpoint  that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit 494 
(Wallis et al. 2010; Wallis et al. 2013; Phillips et al. 2013; Wallis, Peppard, and Hermann  2015; 495 
Wallis and Pepp ard, 2015; Phillips et al. 2016; Meyvisch  et al. 2018) .  A sponsor may consider 496 
other surrogate endpoint s (e.g., biomarker s) that are also  reasonably likely to predict clinical 497 
benefit.  When a drug is approved under accelerated approval, FDA will require that the sponsor  498 
“study the drug further, to verify and describe its clinical benefit”24 including the durability of 499 
the treatment effect .  Sponsors considering sputum culture conversion or other surrogate 500 
endpoints that are reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit should consult with  the Agency as 501 
the clinical trial is being planned.  502 
 503 
C. Other Considerations  504 
 505 
1. Microbiological Considerations  506 
 507 
Sponsors of i nvestigational drugs being evaluated for the treatment of TB  should have supportive 508 
data from in vitro  and in vivo ( animal model ) microbiological studies.  These studies may  509 
provide data to inform selection of the regimen of antimycobacterial drugs to be evaluated in 510 
clinical trials  and to assess the contribution of each drug to the investigational drug regimen . 511 
 512 
a. In vitro  studies  513 
 514 
In vitro  studies should encompass the following:  515 
 516 
• Investigations of drug activity ( inhibiting growth or killing ) against metabolically active, 517 
dormant, and intracellular stages of M. tuberculosis .   518 
 519 
 
24 21 CFR 314.510 for drugs and 21 CFR 601.41 for biological products.  Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 
Draft — Not for Implementation 
14 • Susceptibility testing against metabolically active bacilli from drug -susceptible laboratory 520 
strains , laboratory strains with known patterns of drug resistance, and clin ical isolates 521 
representing different geographical regions.  522 
 523 
• Standardized methods for susceptibility testing such as those recommended by the 524 
Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI).25   525 
 526 • If nonstandard methods are being employed in the trial, prior submission for FDA review 527 
of a complete description of the methods and the performance characteristics of the assay 528 
in the actual laboratory where testing will be done.     529 
 530 • Establishment of q uality control parameters for susceptibility testing  before  531 
determination of in vitro activity .
26   532 
 533 
If two or more new investigational drugs are under evaluation simultaneously, the sponsor 534 
should conduct factorial design  studie s evaluating the new investig ational drugs and provide the 535 
results to the FDA.9  The FDA encourages t esting against multiple strains of M. tuberculosis .  536 
See section  III.C.3.d., In vitro hollow fiber system models , for methods of assessment of the 537 
contribution of individual drugs in a combination regimen. 538 
 539 
b. In vivo ( animal models ) 540 
 541 
Appropriate animal models can serve as an important bridge between the identification of 542 
in vitro  antimycobacterial effects of an investigational drug and the initiation of clinical trials.  543 
PK assessments and changes in drug susceptibility in animal model studies may inform clinical 544 
trial designs.  Sponsors should consider evaluations of the investigational drug, and/ or 545 
combinations of investigational drugs, using different animal mode ls and more than one 546 
strain/isolate of M.  tuberculosis  to study mycobacterial burden and sterilizing activity.  In vivo 547 
studies conducted using a factorial design using clinically relevant exposures can provide 548 
information on the contribution of the individual drugs to the  combination regimen.  549 
 550 
c. Drug resistance and cross- resistance  551 
 552 
Sponsors should examine the pot ential of M. tuberculosis  isolates to develop resistance to the 553 
investigational drug in appropriate in vitro  and/or animal  models and should evaluate the 554 
potential for cross -resistance to drugs in the same class or in other classes  used for the treatment 555 
of TB .  If resistance is demonstrated, it is important to identify the mechanism(s)  of resistance.  556 
 
25 For examples, s ee the guidance for industry and FDA  Class II Special Controls Guidance Document:  
Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems  (August 2009) and CLSI ’s Susceptibility Testing of  Mycobacteria, 
Nocardiae, and Other Aerobic Actinomycetes; Approved Standard — Third Edition , (available at 
https://clsi.org/standards/products/microbiology/documents/m24/ ).  For the most recent version of a class II special 
controls guidance document, check the FDA class II special controls guidance document web page at

Development, Analysis, and Presentation  (February 2018) .  Contains Nonbinding Recommendations  
Draft —  Not for Implementation  
15 Sponsors should attempt  to evaluate the clinical significance of any changes in phenotype (e.g., 557 
in vitro  susceptibility to the investigational drug) or genotype observed in nonclinical studies by 558 
correlating such changes with efficacy outcomes.  559 
 560 
d. Types of culture media  to identify M. tuberculosis  561 
 562 
Solid media (e.g., Löwenstein -Jensen  medium, Middlebrook 7H10 or 7H11 agar media) and 563 
liquid media (e.g., myco bacteria growth indicator tube) are culture assay methods used to 564 
identify and characterize M. tuberculosis .  Sponsors can include other  newer molecular 565 
methodologies  to detect M. tuberculosis  and its susceptibility profile in trials for microbiological 566 
evaluations .  Sponsors should specify the methods used to culture and identify M. tuberculosis  as 567 
well as the in vitro  susceptibility testing methods  that will be employed  in the trial.   568 
 569 
For baseline evaluations, the Agency recommend s using both solid and liquid media.  The 570 
advantages to this approach are (1) more rapid observation of mycobacterial growth in liquid 571 
media (e.g., less than 2 weeks)  and (2) that growth of pure culture on solid media is already 572 
underway for (a) the biochem ical confirmation of M. tuberculosis  and ( b) the evaluation of in 573 
vitro susceptibility.   574 
 575 
For the evaluation of subjects on treatment and aft er treatment completion , sponsors can use 576 
solid or liquid culture media .  Within a clinical trial, the culture meth odologies among trial sites 577 
should be consistent to evaluate all subjects in the trial.   Other types of culture evaluations can be 578 
informative as secondary or exploratory endpoints (e.g., quantitative culture techniques).   579 
 580 
e. Differentiate relapse from reinfection or new infection  581 
 582 
As a secondary analysis, sponsors should  aim to utilize mole cular methods to evaluate whether 583 
clinical failure is caused by relapse of the original infection or by development of a new 584 
infection , especially in subjects living in endemic areas.  If any of these methods are used in a 585 
clinical trial, the sponsor shoul d include details of the methods used as well as performance 586 
characteristics of all assays in the clinical protocol.  587 
 588 
2. Relevant Nonclinical Safety Considerations  589 
 590 
Combination regimens  remain the standard of care  for the treatment of TB.  Individual drugs 591 
may be developed for treatment of active disease although they would be used as part of a 592 
combination regimen .  Nonclinical studies to characterize the safety profile of individual drugs 593 
or a combination regimen and to support clinical trials and approval of a marketing application 594 
will vary, depending on the information available on each drug and the intended patient 595 
population.27  The Agency encourage s sponsors to discuss with the FDA the available toxicology 596 
 
27 For guidance on when to conduct nonclinical combination studies to support clinical trials of combination  
regimen s, see the following: (1) guidance for industry Nonclinical Safety Evaluation of Drug or Biologic 
Combinations  (March 2006) ; (2) ICH guidance  for industry M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of 
Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals ; (3) ICH guidance for industry S6(R1) 
Preclinical Safety Evaluation of Biotechnology -Derived Pharmaceuticals  (May 2012) ; and (4) guidance for industry 
Codevelopment of Two or More New Investigational Drugs for Use in Combination.  Contains Nonbinding Recommendations  
Draft —  Not for Implementation  
16 data for each investigational drug an d a proposal for the clinical development of the combination 597 
regimen . 598 
 599 
Sponsors should conduct nonclinical toxicology studies of a combination regimen consisting of  600 
two or more investigational (unapproved) drugs before initial administration of that combination 601 
regimen to humans based on the following:  602 
 603 
• The availability  of clinical experience with the individual drugs  604 
 605 
• The availability  of relevant nonclinical toxicology data for each of the individual drugs 606 
for the proposed duration of the combination regi men 607 
 608 
• The existence of a significant toxicological concern and the safety margin between the no 609 
observed adverse effects level (NOAEL) for each of the individual drugs in the animal 610 
toxicology studies and the proposed human exposure to each of the investigational drugs 611 
in the combination regimen  612 
 613 
• The potential for drug -drug interaction s based on the absorption, distribution, 614 
metabolism, and excretion of each of the drugs  615 
 616 
• The potential for adverse effects to involve the same organ system ( overlapping 617 
toxicities ) or synergistic toxicities based on a review of accumulated data from each of 618 
the investigational drugs  619 
 620 
Sponsors  should discuss with  the FDA the  type, duration, and timing of  nonclinical toxicology 621 
studies needed to support clinical developme nt of the combination  regimen .  622 
 623 
3. PK/PD Considerations  624 
 625 
a. Phase 1/ phase 2 PK trials  626 
 627 
The PK  of the investigational drug should be fully characterized in single -dose PK, multiple - 628 
dose PK, and phase 2 PK/PD evaluations .  The FDA recommends characterization of PK in 629 
specific populations, including subjects who have renal or hepatic impairment, as well as an 630 
evaluation of the drug effect on the QT interval .28  631 
 632 
b. Drug interactions  633 
 634 
Sponsors should conduct i n vitro studies to determine the pote ntial of the investigational drug to 635 
act as a substrate, inhibitor , or inducer of major human metabolizing enzymes  and relevant 636 
transporters .29  Based on these results, drug interaction evaluations  between one or more of the 637

Potential for Non -Antiarrhythmic Drugs  — Questions and Answers  (R1) (October 2012) . 
 
29 See the guidance for industry In Vitro Drug Interaction Studies — Cytochrome P450 Enzyme - and Transporter -
Mediated Drug Interactions  (January 2020).  Contains Nonbinding Recommendations  
Draft —  Not for Implementation  
17 antimycobacterial drugs used in the planned combination regimen, or with  drugs unrelated to the 638 
treatment of TB but likely to be used concomitantly for other indications  (e.g., antiretroviral 639 
therapy for treatment of HIV; antiviral therapy for treatment of hepatitis B or C ), may be needed 640 
before initiating clinical efficacy trials.30  The Agency strongly recommends that sponsors 641 
consult the FDA during drug development regarding appropriate drug interaction evaluations .  642 
 643 
c. Exposure  response  644 
 645 
Sponsors should explore e xposure -response relationships during early phases of drug 646 
development to aid in the selection of optimal dosing strategies for evaluation in later trials.31  647 
The FDA encourages sponsors to explore exposure -response  relationships for both sputum and 648 
serum drug concentrations and markers of activity (e.g., the time -to-sputum -conversion or 649 
sputum conversion rate at 2 months in subjects  with pulmonary TB ). 650 
 651 
d. In vitro hollow fiber system models  652 
 653 
The re sults from hollow fiber system models, combined with other sources of nonclinical data, 654 
can help inform the selection of antimycobacterial drug regimens to begin clinical evaluation 655 
(Chilukuri  et al. 2015).  The hollow fiber system models can be used to si mulate PK  656 
characteristics of drugs intended to treat TB and allows for the exploration of concentration- 657 
effect relationships potentially relevant to the treatment of TB  in the clinical setting.  T hese 658 
models are expected to provide key information on regim en selection for further evaluation.  659 
These models may also play an important role in evaluating the contribution of each drug (at 660 
clinically relevant exposures) to the treatment effect . 661 
 662 
4. Foreign Clinical Data32 663 
 664 
FDA regulations permit the acceptance of foreign clinical trials in support of a new drug 665 
application (NDA)  or biologics license application (BLA)  approval  (21 CFR 312.120).   666 
 667 
5. Data standards for TB  668 
 669 
Study data standards describe a standard ized way to exchange clinical and nonclinical research 670 
data between computer systems.  Data standards have been developed for TB to provide a 671

18 consistent general framework for organizing study data, including templates for datasets, 672 
standard names for variables, and standard ways of doing calculations with common variables.33   673 
 674 
6. Labeling Considerations 675 
 676 
Generally, the labeled indication should reflect the patient population enrolled in the clinical 677 
trials.  For example , sponsors should consider the following : 678 
 679 
Drug X is indicated in combination with Drugs Y and Z for the treatment of pulmonary 680 
tuberculosis. 681 
 682 
or  683 
 684 
Drug X is indicated in combination with other antimycobacterial drugs  for the treatment 685 
of pulmonary tuberculosis.  686 
 687 For drugs approved under accelerated approval, the sponsor must include additional information 688 
in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE  section (see 21 CFR 201.57(c)(2)(i)(B)).
34  For drugs 689 
approved  under the l imited population pathway for a ntibacterial and antifungal drugs, additional 690 
information is available for specific labeling requirements and recommendations.35, 36691

21 APPENDIX 771 
Example of a Justification for a Noni nferiority Margin  772 
in a Treatment -Shortening Clinical Trial of Pulmonary Tuberculosis  773 
 774 
This appendix provides an example of a noninferiority (NI) margin justification.  As stated in 775 
this guidance, NI  margin  justification s are dependent on the specific design of the NI  trial.  This 776 
justification is for a specific NI  trial that w ould compare a n investigational drug  regimen 777 
consisting of a new investigational drug plus the first 4 months of the standard regimen to the 778 
standard  6-month regimen in subjects with drug -susceptible tuberculosis ( TB).  The effect of the 779 
investigational drug essentially replaces the effect of Months 5 and 6 of the standard regimen.  780 
Using historical data, t his justification  determines the effect of these 2 months of therapy 781 
(historical evidence of sensitivity to drug e ffects  (HESDE )) to de termine if the new 782 
investigational drug is effective based on the results of the NI  trial.  Additional information is 783 
available regarding a complete discussion of NI  trials and justification s of margins .1 784 
 785 We identified two  trials that allowed for an esti mate of the effect of M onths 5 and 6 in the 786 
standard regimen for drug -susceptible TB , based on a comparison of the standard-of- care 787 
regimen (2 months of treatment with ethambutol (or streptomycin), isoniazid, rifampin, and 788 
pyrazinamide followed by 4 months of treatment with isoniazid and rifampin, which is often 789 
described in abbreviated terminology as 2EHRZ/4HR or 2SHRZ/4HR ) to a 4- month regimen  of 790 
2EHRZ/2HR  or 2SHRZ/2HR.
2  The endpoint of unfavorable outcome was defined as one of the 791 
following: (1)  subjects who never become sputum culture negative for M. tuberculosis  while on 792 
therapy; (2) subjects who had microbiological confirmation of relapse of pulmonary TB within a 793 
12-month period of observation following therapy completion; or (3) subjects who died at any 794 
time within the clinical trial drug administration period and 12-month period of observation 795 
following therapy completion. 796 
 797 Table A , below, contains the results from the two trials  among subjects randomized to receive 798 
the 6- month regimen or the 4- month regimen .  A comparison of the two regimens gives an 799 
estimate of the effect of the final 2 months of the 6 -month regimen of 8.4 percent with a lower 800 
bound of the 95 percent confidence interval of 4.8 percent; 4.8 percent can be used as a 801 
conservative estimate of the treatment effect of Months 5 and 6 of treatment.  802

** The number of deaths is unknown for Study 1 and therefore is not included in the outcome.   The 6 -month and 4 - 810

occurred close in time.   Study 1: Singapore Tuberculosis Service/British Medical Research Council, 1986, Long - 812

In an NI  trial in subjects with drug- susceptible pulmonary TB  where a tr eatment -shortening 822 
regimen is compared to a standard 6-month regimen, the selection of a n NI margin of 4.8 percent  823 
can be supported by the historical data .  The NI  margin  justification presented here is a 824 
modification of the justification presented in Nunn et al . 2008 .3   825 
 826 
Although an NI  margin of 4.8 percent may seem over ly conservative, the fact that a very high 827 
proportion of subjects achieve a successful primary efficacy outcome with standard of care 828 
provides for a reasonable estimate o f the sample size for  an NI  trial.  Additionally, given the high 829 
proportion of subjects achieving a successful outcome, there is interest in maintaining this high 830 
proportion in new investigational drug regimens.  For example, we identified a trial (Johnson et 831 
al. 2009)4 that described halting of the trial by a data monitoring committee based on an 832 
approximately 5 percentage point estimate difference between the standard regimen and a 833 
treatment- shortening regimen, indicating that there is a clinical expecta tion that there should be a 834 
high proportion of subjects achieving successful outcome s in both treatment groups, making the 835 
selection of a n NI margin of 4.8 percent a feasible consideration.   836

23 The following example provide s a framework for discus sion with the FDA about sample size 838 
estimation  for an NI  trial evaluating a treatment -shortening regimen (Makuch and Simon 1980) .5  839 
The total sample size of enrolled subjects is approximately 480 subject s per arm  based on the 840 
follow ing assumptions: (1) the identification of Mycobacterium tuberculosis  in 90 percent  of 841 
enrolled subjects (primary analysis population is approximately 430 subjects per arm); (2) a two - 842 
sided type I error of 0.05 and power of 90 percent ; (3) for both arms, a  rate of 5  percent  of 843 
subjects who have the endpoint of failure to convert to negative sputum cultures , or who 844 
experience relapse of TB , or death at a 12 -month period of observation; and (4) an NI  margin of 845 
4.8 percent . 846 
 847 
Sponsors should discuss with the FDA appropriate NI  margins for specific NI  trials being 848 
proposed.  849
